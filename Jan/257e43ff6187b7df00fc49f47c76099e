Joseph Opio has always been serious about comedy. So serious, in fact, that he walked away from a promising newspaper job in Kampala, borrowed a large sum of money, and went to the U.S. to try to make people laugh. Joseph Opio and his fellow writers on The Daily Show have been nominated for the 68th annual Writer's Guild of America awards in the comedy category.
