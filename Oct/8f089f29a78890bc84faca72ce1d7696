Simanjiro â€” The government has set aside a total of Sh700 million for a project aimed at alleviating a water shortage problem here. This was revealed on Friday by the Water and Irrigation minister, Mr Isack Kamwelwe. "This scheme will enable 85 per cent of the 100,000 Simanjiro dwellers to have access to water services," noted Mr Kamwelwe. He said the project was expected to begin any time as money was already in the government's hands. Mr Kamwelwe ordered Babati Water and Sanitation Authority (Bawasa) boss Idd Msuya to ensure the project commenced within a space of six months. "We must walk the talk on President Magufuli's promise to provide people of this area with water, a promise which he made during his recent visit here," he committed. For his part, Bawasa's Msuya vowed not to let down the minister, saying the project would start within six months as per the minister's order. Simanjiro District commissioner Zephania Chaula commended the minister's tour of the area, saying by ensuring water was available, one of the district's priorities would be fulfilled. "Three priorities, which are education, health and water top the list of our priorities. We thank the government for helping us to fulfil one of the priorities," noted Mr Chaula. (Joseph Lyimo)
