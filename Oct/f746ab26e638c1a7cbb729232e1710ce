The continent is facing major problems, from corruption, unemployment, lack of access to quality education and decent health care. The public health systems of many Africa countries are in shambles, in desperate need of financial investment but leaders travel to European and Asian nations to seek medical care. In August South Africa's Health Minister Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said African leaders should be "ashamed" of the practice, and "We must promote our own," public health systems. Corruption on the continent has also remained a major problem affecting social and economic development. This lack of political will and willingness to fight corruption has been fuelling the scourge on the continent, preventing millions of people from escaping the cycle of extreme poverty.
