Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/Doctors Without Borders said staff were harassed and an ambulance attacked in Mathare, Nairobi while picking up a patient.

MSF's head of mission in Kenya, Abubakr Bakri, condemned the violations. "I call on all communities to provide and ensure unconditional and safe access to those affected and to medical teams, so that casualties are attended to in a timely manner," Bakri said. MSF disclosed it had at the time of publishing treated victims of violence in Nairobi, Kisumu and Homa Bay Counties. State security personnel are accused of the perpetrations that left at least three people reported dead on Thursday. It is estimated up to 70 have been killed between the runup to the August 8 annulled election and the most recent one. More violence was forecasted with incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta most likely to emerge victorious ahead of challenger, Raila Odinga, who boycotted the poll fearing a rigged exercise.
