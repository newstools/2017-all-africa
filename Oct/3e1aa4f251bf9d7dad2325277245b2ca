Chimurenga music exponent Thomas Mapfumo has cancelled a gig pencilled for the UK over non-payment of fees by sponsors. The music legend now domiciled in the US confirmed the cancellation of the tour through his publicist, Blessing Vava. "Chimurenga Music Company wishes to inform our fans in Leicester, UK that the music guru Dr Thomas Mapfumo will not be performing there on the 28th of October as advertised. "This is due to non-fulfilment of contractual obligations by the promoters, Phab Entertainment. We sincerely apologize to all our fans for the inconvenience caused. It was beyond our control," Vava said in a short statement posted on social media. After being effectively banned from Zimbabwe at the turn of the century because of his criticism of Mugabe's government, Mapfumo has had to contend with staging tours in countries playing host to hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans who left the country after escaping political and economic turmoil at home. Mapfumo has consistently toured the UK and South Africa in particular given the large number of Zimbabweans but has indicated his willingness to "go home one day".
