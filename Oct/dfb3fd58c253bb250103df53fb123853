Nigeria's poor become poorer due to ill health, and ill health worsens poverty in a vicious cycle, says global health leader Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, CEO of Big Win Foundation. But in a distinguished lecture at Ondo State University of Medical Sciences in his home country of Nigeria, Dr. Pate - who led a successful polio vaccination campaign in conflict-wracked north-east Nigeria, when he was minister of state for health - points to signs of progress. He argues that bold, visionary leadership and the recognition that Nigeria's economic development depends on better health services can transform the country.
