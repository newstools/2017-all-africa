Tuesday, October 17th, 2017  Iowa Events Center730 3rd StreetDes Moines, Iowa 50309  View Program | Register Now The agribusiness sector in Africa is extremely important to the continent’s economic development accounting for approximately 40 percent of total economic output and providing employment for roughly 50 percent of the workforce. Despite its importance, agricultural productivity lags behind other developing regions of the globe, undermining Africa’s overall productivity and food security. Over the last two decades growth has occurred in several African countries, but work remains. The business sector is a critical link to economic growth connecting policy and regulatory decisions with actual outcomes. Private and public sector leaders will come together for one day of intense collaboration to identify ways to improve and connect operations in the three major agricultural value chains (production, processing, and marketing / distribution). Building on the World Food Prize, the Forum aims to drive insight and inspiration to catalyze actionable recommendations to effectively engage businesses in Africa’s agribusiness sector. These insights and recommendations will be delivered to the United States government and Corporate Council on Africa membership.
