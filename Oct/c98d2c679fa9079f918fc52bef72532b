At least two civilians were killed, and several others wounded in a remote-controlled landmine blast near Jowhar town, the regional capital of Middle Shabelle province. The explosion has resulted from an explosive device hidden in a water container left on the banks of a river at Munkay area, according to a resident, who spoke to Radio Shabelle. Somali security forces cordoned off the scene following the bomb explosion and launched a manhunt in the area, but no arrest has been reported so far. No group has so far claimed to credit of the blast, and the target still remains unclear.
