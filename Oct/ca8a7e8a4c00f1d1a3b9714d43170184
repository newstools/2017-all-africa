Makurdi â€” Maliki Amula is a Geography graduate of the Nasarawa State university who is set to affect the youths of his society positively with his hip-hop music. Amula launched himself into the music world in 2012 at the beginning of his course in the university and ever since, he has continued to move up the ladder with his sonorous voice. "I do music by putting down my thoughts in a creative way," he said. The young hip-hop singer and rap artiste said he would take music to the highest height by using the situations around him as motivating factor to affect all classes of people positively, especially, the youths. Already, he has released five singles to his credit and performed in different places including a pool side party at the institution he graduated from. Though his greatest challenge at this point remains funding, the Benue born rising star however believes he would somehow surmount the mountain as he plans to take on music as a full fledged career on completion of the compulsory national youth service which would commence for him in November, this year. In an interview with our correspondent in Makurdi, he emphasised that: "I see things around me and want to put it into music. I'm hoping to take on music fully soon after my service year." Amula no doubt has enjoyed some level of patronage which makes him thinks that music to an extent is quite lucrative as the responses from his audience so far in his estimation are encouraging. To this end, he assured of pursing his dream and making a positive difference among his peers for the benefit of the vulnerable in the society. "I'm using my music to remove idle youths from the streets and give them a purpose for living," Amula maintained.
