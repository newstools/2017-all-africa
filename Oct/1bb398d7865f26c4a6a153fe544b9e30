Benin Citly â€” Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted a popular musician and social critic, Ambassador Osayomore Joseph, in his village at Orovie, near Benin City. His wife was reportedly shot in the process on the head. Osayomore was kidnapped around 10:00p.m. at Orovie village, off Upper Ekewan road in Egor local government area on Tuesday. Reacting to the abduction, Edo police spokesman, DSP Moses Nkombe, said police received report about the abduction around 11:00p.m. Nkombe said security operatives have been drafted to hot spots across the state. He assured that the police would do its best to secure the release of Osayomore. It would be recalled that on September 24, three policemen stationed at the Ogba Zoo and Nature Park were killed by kidnappers while the Managing Director of the zoo, Dr. Andy Ehanire, was abducted. Andy, a brother to the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, is yet to be released by his abductors. On September 27, the Parish Priest of St. Benedict Church, Iddo 2, Okpella of Auchi Diocese, Fr. Lawrence Adorolo, was abducted along Auchi-Okene highway. He was released two days later after the Catholic authorities refused to pay ransom. Meanwhile, the Edo State branch of the Performing Musician Association of Nigeria (PMAN) has condemned the kidnapping of Osayomore. It said the kidnapping of Osayomore was an abomination because the victim was abducted shortly after he performed at the palace of the Oba of Benin. State chairman of PMAN, Eghenova Willie, in a press statement called for the unconditional release of Osayomore just as he called on Governor Godwin Obaseki to beef up security in the state.
