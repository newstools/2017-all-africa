The city of Cape Town is experiencing the worst drought in its recorded history. Here are five things about it that you should know: 1. The City of Cape Town anticipates that its supply of municipal water will run out around March 2018; 2. Water restrictions have been in place since 2005. These were intensified in December 2015 and have been made more extreme since then; 3. In May this year, the City of Cape Town realised its water saving measures - which focused on driving down demand and supplementing supply - were not working. It, therefore, had to relook at its plan; 4. The City of Cape Town is looking into various ways to boost access to water - this includes sea-based desalination, water reclamation and groundwater abstraction projects. It is also looking at ways to access money to accommodate these plans; 5. Some experts believe that trying to turn the water crisis around at this point will be too costly and that water may run out before plans properly get off the ground. Source: News24
