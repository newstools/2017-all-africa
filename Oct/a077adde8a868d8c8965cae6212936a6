A tweep has somehow diffused the tension among most Kenyans online as the voting exercise continues, with a hilarious caption to a picture showing heavy police presence in Kibra The online user going by the name Phelix G-Cord captioned the photo: "Police turn up to vote in Kibra as residents watch them from a distance." Police turn up to vote in Kibra as residents watch them from a distance. #ElectionBoycottKE pic.twitter.com/C8U7i0uMY4 -- Phelix G-Cord (@PhelixOchola) October 26, 2017 Anti-riot police engaged youths in Kibera in running battles on Thursday after the road leading to Olympic Primary School, the biggest polling station in the area, was barricaded with stones. Polling stations were opened from 6am, with a slow but steady flow of voters being seen making their way to the polling stations to cast their votes. The repeat presidential elections has been hampered by various hurdles including Nasa Leader Raila Odinga withdrawing his candidature and asking his supporters not to participate in the exercise. Here are some reactions from KOT on the hilarious caption. @mbengeiKE police are Kenyans men. They have a right to vote. -- kipronohben (@kipronohben1) October 26, 2017 U didnt get it😂😂its ironic -- Blackman king (@JTuluke) October 26, 2017 Today's stand up comedy is on ⚡⚡⚡😂😂😂😂😂😂👏 pic.twitter.com/DZBJUnmTz8 -- Jay B (@digitalmkenya) October 26, 2017 Residents offering security ti hi hi hi -- WonderWoman (@_IamAnAmazon_) October 26, 2017 Reversed roles.
