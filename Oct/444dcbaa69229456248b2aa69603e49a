In commemorating 100 years since the birth of Oliver Tambo, the house in which he used to stay in Zambia, will be unveiled as a National Heritage site. The house, which has now been painted in ANC colours, was assigned to Tambo by the Zambian Government as his safe house when he was exiled in the country for fighting against the aparttheid government. Nelson Mandela was in prison at the time.
