"I depend on constructive debate to help and inform the work I have been elected to do," said World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Today's statement rescinded Tedros's announcement two days ago appointing President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe as WHO Goodwill Ambassador to promote attention to non-communicable diseases. The following day, after strong negative reactions from global health leaders and human rights leaders, Tedros tweeted: "I'm listening. I hear your concerns. Rethinking the approach in light of WHO values." Now, he says, "I have decided to rescind the appointment." Reaction has been immediate, mixing relief over the prompt change of course with questions about how the decision could have been made in the first place.
