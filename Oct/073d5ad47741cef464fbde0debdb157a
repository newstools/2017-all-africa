While the recently concluded Uganda Festival in Las Vegas is still fresh in all minds of revelers and guests from Diaspora, thanks to electrifying performances from a host of musicians, another festival is already in the offing just months away. The previous festival featured a series of artistes from Nigerian singing duo Psquare, Ugandan song bird Juliana Kanyomozi, to a cocktail of Sheebah Karungi, King Saha, Naava Grey and Ang3lina. However, another festival is already in offing, again organized by the UNAA Causes, this time in USA's capital- Washington DC, from August 31 to September 3 2018. As has been the highlight of all conventions organized by the UNAA Causes, entertainment and fun have been in plenty, characterized by partying and nonstop performances from not less than 6 major artistes. A number of artistes including Uganda's oldest band, Afrigo, have already been set aside as well as an exclusive dinner with live music on a boat cruise for a whole 6hours.
