The Minister of tourism should revisit his statement that has gone viral on how his Ministry would handle the 'Bumser'. Government should realise that 'Bumsers' are youth without any alternative means of income. The task is to help them earn an income, without harassing tourist. It is the Ministry that should carry out the civic education and cooperate with other Ministries, to give youth employment. The Minister should visit the social media to find out what he said about 'Bumsers', and remedy the position he took.
