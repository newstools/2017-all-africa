Khartoum â€” SOUTH Sudan has appealed for the intervention of international humanitarian agencies to stop a deadly outbreak of measles that has claimed the lives of at least ten children. The minors have died in the northern Payinjiar County. Most of the victims are aged under five. A majority of the infected children died before they could access health facilities. Stephen Gatliah Kuay, the Payinjiar health supervisor, lamented the situation as dire, pointing out the war-torn region lacked the capacity to bring the situation under control. "I would like to request United Nations agencies like the UN Children Fund and World Health Organization to support us through our health partners," he appealed. Among the health partners struggling under conflict to address the situation are the International rescue Committee and the UN International Development Organisation. Measles is the latest scourge to afflict the world's newest country. The East African country is gripped by a war that started in 2013, two years after independence from Sudan. The civil war emanating from a fallout between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and his deputy, Riek Machar Dhurgon, has sparked the crisis. Over 4 million have been displaced. Thousands that have sought refuge in makeshift sites are succumbing to hunger and cholera, among other crises. - CAJ News
