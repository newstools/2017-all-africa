Makurdi â€” Maliki Amula is a Geography graduate of the Nasarawa State University, Keffi who is set to affect the youth of his society positively with his hip-hop music. Amula launched himself into the music world in 2012 at the beginning of his course in the university and ever since, he has continued to move up the ladder with his sonorous voice. In an interview with the Daily Trust YOUTHVIlLE in Makurdi, Amula said, "I make music by putting down my thoughts in a creative way." The young hip-hop singer and rap artiste said he would take music to the highest height by using the situations around him as motivating factor to affect all classes of people positively, especially, the youth. Already, he has released five singles to his credit and performed in different places including a pool side party at the institution he graduated from. Though his greatest challenge remains funding, the rising star however believes he would somehow surmount it as he drives his career with full force after his one year National Youth Service ending next month. "I see things around me and want to put it into music. I'm hoping to take on music fully soon after my service year," he emphasized. Amula no doubt has enjoyed some level of patronage which makes him think that music to an extent is quite lucrative as the responses from his audience so far in his estimation are encouraging. "I'm using my music to remove idle youth from the streets and give them a purpose for living," Amula maintained.
