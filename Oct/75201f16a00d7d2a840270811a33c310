Zimbabwean beautician Ruby Lynn scooped the Female Entrepreneur of the Year Award in Australian Saturday at the inaugural Zimbabwe Achievers Awards event held in the city of Adelaide. The makeup artist, who is nurse by profession, was honoured for remarkable creativity which has seen her Ruby Lynn Luxury Cosmetics range making waves in Australia. In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Lynn said she was delighted to be recognised by Zim Achievers Awards. "I feel so happy; I am overwhelmed with joy right now. I still can't believe it," she said. "If it wasn't for the support that I receive from the ladies on my Facebook page, Kugeza neRunako naRubby Lyn, the makeup line would not be in existence. "I'm so grateful and would like to thank everyone who voted for me." Her cosmetics range has made a huge impact among African women and is now available in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands among others. The products are available online as well as through shops in some countries in addition to beauty salons in Harare, Avondale and in Bulawayo. Lyn said she started the business after struggling to find cosmetics that are suitable for her dark skin tone in Australia. Lynn beauty products range is made from powdered mineral foundations, blushes, brushes and lipsticks among other things. The company's theme is hakuna mukadzi akashata (no woman is ugly). The Zimbabwe Achievers Awards Australia are aimed at recognising and acknowledging Zimbabweans in the Diaspora who are making a positive contribution to the communities they live in and their country.
