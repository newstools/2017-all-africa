University of Cape Town (UCT) students, led by the student representative council (SRC), have met at Jameson Hall to discuss the proposed fee increase for 2018. According to SRC member Sihle Lonzi, fees are set to increase by 8-10%. Lonzi said the university said it was operating at a deficit and was forced to increase fees between 8-10%. #uctshutdown 8-10% increase would not cover UCT's expenses which would "be horrible for this institution, but we don't care." @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/exX68vGE21-- James de Villiers (@pejames) October 24, 2017 Lonzi said the SRC would respond "decisively" to the proposed 8-10% hike, and would "be 'touring' campus this afternoon".
