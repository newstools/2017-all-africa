Last week, the task force helping to fight the Marburg virus outbreak in eastern Uganda asked police to hunt for Joseph Cherungu, who had reportedly been a caregiver to his sister, who died of the virus. When he was found, he had Marburg-like symptoms and was placed in isolation but later died. A ministry of health spokesperson saidÂ  a blood sample Cherungu tested positive for the disease.
