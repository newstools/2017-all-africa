Popular rapper AKA has announced on Twitter that he and his girlfriend Bonang Matheba had broken up. The couple have been together for two years. Myself and Bonang have decided to call it quits. I feel like I need to put this out there so we can both move on. I wish her all the best and I will always love her. ❤️ Bonang cryptically sent out a tweet - perhaps alluding to the break-up. "Choose joy... once you choose and place your attention on wanting to flow there, the universe will shift for you and inspire you to the action needed to take you there...." If we recall, earlier this year the rapper made an announcement that they were no longer a couple, only to confirm later that the "break-up" was just a PR stunt. Should we expect or a new song or this is finally over?
