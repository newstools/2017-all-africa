The 2017 edition of Miss Goodwill Ambassador Nigeria (MGAN) pageant is set to hold this evening at Sheraton Hotel Abuja. The pageant organiser, Mr Chris Odey said MGAN pageantry is focused on humanitarian services, as such height and weight restrictions do not apply. Speaking to YOUTHVILLE, the camp coordinator Emma Bricks Oko said six out of 18 participants will be crowned as queens for the national and regional levels. He explained that the contestants had a week long residential camp where they were taught, on etiquettes, stage presence, catwalk, choreography and so on. "Whoever is crowned will have to carry out projects that have humanitarian value and give succour to the less privileged," he explained.
