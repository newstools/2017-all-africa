Kano State Government says it is planning to spend over N80 million in the Maternal Newborn and Child Health Week (MNCH). The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Kabiru Getso, announced this at a news Conference ahead of the week in Kano. Getso said during the programme, over 2.6 million children below the age of six were expected to be supplemented with Vitamin A, while other children would receive free immunization against communicable diseases. According to him, "about 650 pregnant women will also have access to free ante natal screening as well as other treatments such as malaria". The commissioner recalled that in the previous MNCH week, over 1.3 million children received the Vitamin A supplement. He lauded the efforts of all the stakeholders in the health sector, especially the Kano Emirate, for supporting the ministry in providing quality health care. Getso restated the commitment of Gov. Ganduje's administration in providing quality health care for the people of the state, especially women and children, the most vulnerable group. The free health care will begin from Dec. 18 to 22, with all the Primary Health Care centres to be involved in provision of the services.
