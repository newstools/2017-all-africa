The House of Representatives Public Petitions Committee will quiz the Ministers of Transport Rotimi Amaechi and Defence Mansur Dan-Ali over a concession contract for Nigerian waterways reportedly to an Israeli company. The committee, chaired by Uzoma Nkem-Abonta (PDP, Abia) also called on the Federal Government and all other parties involved in the planned concession contract, to gulp about $195million to put all actions on hold, pending the outcome of investigation. Nkem-Abonta told journalists in Abuja yesterday that the panel would demand that the two ministers explain the rationale behind such decision. The committee's action followed a petition the House received from some civil society organizations, alleging that the ministry of transport has decided to cede the management and security of Nigeria's waterways to an Israeli security firm, HLSI Security Firms and Technologies.
