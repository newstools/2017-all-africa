During the kick-off at the weekend at the state specialist hospital in Jalingo, reiterated his administration's commitment to prioritise the health needs of the people. He said: " A healthy citizen, just like a peaceful atmosphere, is paramount for development of any society. Government is serious about ensuing good health for the people of Taraba State and this is why we are taking a bold stand against hepatitis." The exercise, according to him, would provide free screening and vaccination for our people and we will also treat those who are positive."
