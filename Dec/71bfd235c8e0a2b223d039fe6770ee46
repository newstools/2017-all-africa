Nairobi â€” The Employment and Labour Relations Court has stopped court proceedings in a case involving the sacking of 157 Kenya Airways engineers and technicians who were reinstated on Monday. This is after KQ lawyers filed a motion at the Court of Appeal challenging the reinstatement order given by Justice Hellen Wasilwa. Justice Wasilwa was told that immediately after the orders of reinstatement were given, the KQ management went ahead and served all the engineers with letters sending them on compulsory leave. However, Wasilwa stopped the proceedings to allow the Court of Appeal time to hear and determine the national carrier's contention and protest against the court order. KQ argued that they were not given time to submit their responses on the orders of reinstatement given by the court. Justice Wasilwa reinstated them on grounds that it was very unsafe for passengers to fly on planes that are not serviced, given that it is a high travelling season.
