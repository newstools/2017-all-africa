The State Minister for Tourism, Mr Godfrey Kiwanda has launched the Kampala Sight Seeing Bus campaign which is aimed at promoting tourism in Kampala City. Mr Kiwanda says Kampala residents and visitors complain about traffic jam but yet it is also a tourism product which the city can offer. "Instead of going to the bars or church, you can decide to stand by the road and count cars and also watch how Ugandans drive. Ugandans know much about capital cities like Nairobi, Mombasa, New York but do not know Kampala," he said. The bus will move to various tourism sites in the city. Foreigners will be charged $30 (110,000) while Ugandans will pay Shs100, 00 to tour the city. Last year, Mr Kiwanda launched the Kampala Rolex Festival to promote the popular local street food. The snack, known as 'Rolex' in Uganda is a rolled chapatti containing eggs and vegetables and meat, depending on the buyer's preference.
