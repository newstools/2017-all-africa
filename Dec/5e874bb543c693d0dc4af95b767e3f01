Monrovia â€” Green City has certificated 100 urban youth from 10 slum communities in Montserrado County in waste management and recycling.

Speaking at the program marking the certification and turning over of the project materials to the beneficiaries over the weekend, the Executive Director of Green City, Mr. James K. Mulbah, said according to a research done; most of the wastes in streets are "inorganic wastes," something he said could be recycled to generate income for families. The Executive Director of Green City further said that the beneficiaries were trained in circle social counseling and also conflict resolution, in addition to waste management. With this initiative, Mulbah said they (Green City) will buy the wastes, mainly plastic materials, from the beneficiaries and in return turn those wastes into something valuable. "Plastic will be more attended to; especially in the urban areas," the Executive Director of Green City disclosed. Mulbah added: "We will give 25 Liberian Dollar for a kilogram of plastic." Also speaking, Alonso Torres, an Environmental Engineer of UNMIL Environmental Unit, termed the project as a unique one.
