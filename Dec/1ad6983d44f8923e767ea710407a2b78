We would like to thank Solange for her ongoing support, and for sharing this year with us at AFROPUNK festivals around the world. It is incredibly important to those of us at AFROPUNK that she recovers and remains in good health. Her music and spirit has been a place of great comfort and inspiration to us as a community. And of course we are incre dibly saddened that she will no longer be performing at the inaugural AFROPUNK Joburg this weekend. We at AFROPUNK would like to deeply apologise to all festival-goers and ticket-holders, but the circumstances of this news are completely out of AFROPUNK’s control. Solange was greatly looking forward to being a part of this historic occasion, and as her statement makes clear, she has vowed to come back to Johannesburg with AFROPUNK at a later date. Despite this very sad news, AFROPUNK Joburg continues to look forward to welcoming many of the world’s finest artists, creatives and music fans to Joburg’s Constitution Hill on the 30th and 31st of December.
