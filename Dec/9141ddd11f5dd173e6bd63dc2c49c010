Lagos â€” THE Nigerian Court of Appeal has dismissed an appeal filed by 14 foreign nationals contesting their conviction for oil theft. Officers from the Nigerian Navy arrested the convicts from Japan, Philippines, Russia and Ukraine and intercepted their vessel, loaded with crude oil estimated at 1 738 tonnes in 2015. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against them. The Federal High Court in the commercial city of Lagos sentenced 11 out of the convicted suspects to two years imprisonment each, with an option of N5 million (R176 150) fine. Three of the foreign nationals, who had jumped bail and absconded, were convicted and sentenced in absentia to five years imprisonment without an option of fine. The court ordered the forfeiture of the vessel. Following the ruling, the accused had approached the appellate court to set aside the judgment. However, in a judgment read today by Justice Garuba Haruna, the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the lower court convicting them. Oil theft is rampant in Nigeria, the continent's biggest oil producer and largest economy. The scourge is costing treasury an estimated US$1 billion (R12,7 billion) on a monthly basis.
