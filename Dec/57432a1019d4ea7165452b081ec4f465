Abeokuta â€” The fuel situations in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital worsened on Tuesday as long queues surfaced in the metropolis. Our Correspondent who monitored the situation reports that few of the stations with product to sell recorded long queues along the Obantoko axis, on the old Abeokuta Ibadan road and Abeokuta/Lagos road, around Ita oshin area. Also, the Sokenu road, Lafenwa recorded similar long queues, with virtually all filling stations along the road closing their stations. The development has resulted in commuters getting stranded at bus stops, while the roads are partially empty. Early traders and public servants heading to their various places of trade and offices were seen scrambling for few commercial vehicles. Some of officials of the stations claimed that there was no stock and there is nothing they can do while others with stock say they only got fuel late in night. "This is why you see the long queues here. The motorists wil be calling themselves to come to the station," an official at Lafenwa filling station told our Correspondent.
