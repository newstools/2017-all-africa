This week has been a great week in the music industry and for music lovers. Just when the performance of Wizkid and Davido was still on the lips of Nigerians, Davido decided to bring all the Mo'Hit stars on stage to perform some of their hit songs. Nigerians who attended the sold-out concert as well as the over 50,000 fans who kept a close tab on the concert via Snapchat, Instagram live and twitter could not contain their excitement.
