HOTEL and Lodge owners in Kitwe have been urged not to promote illicit activities in their facilities especially during the festive period. Shebourne hotel Manager Richard Kavwanda said illicit behavior such as supporting underage drinking, sex parties and the use of psychotropic substances had the potential to dent the reputation of the hospitality industry. Speaking in an interview, Mr Kavwanda called of hotel and lodge owners to ensure that security was tightened and inspections conducted within the premises in order to stop people from indulging in dangerous activities. "Am appealing to lodge and hotel owners to monitor the people who are entering their premises so that illicit activities such as underage drinking, abuse of drugs and sex parties are not encouraged because they have the potential to dent the image of the hospitality industry," he said. He said many youth were in the habit of involving themselves in dangerous activities during the festive season hence the need to safeguard them. Mr Kavwanda added that the business community should take keen interest in addressing some of the challenges that are faced in the areas in which they operate as part of their social responsibility. He said management at Shebourne would soon adopt and render assistance to two hospital wards as a way of giving back to the community.
