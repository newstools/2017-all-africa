Bongo flava songbird Lady Jay Dee has rubbished claims attributing her music career success to witchcraft. Jay Dee has been ruling the airwaves for over a decade and a half now and is arguably the most successful female musician in East Africa. She is set to drop her second single 'kibao' featuring Nigerian boyfriend Spicy under Kenyan label Taurus Musik since signing a multi-million three year contract. Whereas she started doing music with her peers the likes of Ray C, Stara Thomas, Unique Sisters, Zay B, Raha P, Dataz, Sister P back in the late 90s, she is the only one still on top as her colleagues flaundered. With Jide coming from a country that beliefs in use of black magic to fuel success, some quarters have chosen to believe that this is the sole reason as to why she has been able to keep on top of the game all this years. LAUGHED OFF ALLEGATIONS However Jide has laughed off the allegations, stating that she has been consistent with her music and meeting the market's demand. "Ni kujitambua tu na kuweka malengo na bidii, hakuna uchawi. Mimi muziki ndiyo kazi yangu, naenda nao kulingana na mahitaji ya soko, siwezi kujua kwa nini wenzangu walikwama, inawezekana hii siyo kazi yao namba moja, tuna tofautiana maisha, kila mtu ana kipaumbele chake. Mimi nimechagua kazi ya muziki, kila kitu napata kutokana na muziki, kwa hiyo lazima niwe makini na kazi" she said in a Whatsapp conversation. While at it, Jay Dee also revealed her plans to do an album under Taurus Musik that she will only feature her current boyfriend. "Nimemshirikisha Spicy kwa sababu anafit kwenye nafasi ile, ni msanii lakini kumbuka pia ni mwenza wangu, nadhani nitafanya video nyingi pamoja naye, hata kumi ikibidi, kwani kuna ubaya wowote? she posed.
