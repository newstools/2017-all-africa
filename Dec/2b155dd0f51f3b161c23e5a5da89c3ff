The militants, who were armed, surrendered to Somali national army and state forces in Dinsor district in Somalia's Bay region, which is located in the south west of the country. "The six armed militants had weapons and one technical. They had traveled from Arabow where Al-Shabaab militants are hiding themselves," Dinsor Commissioner Ibrahim Mohamed Shigshigow told media. Somali forces backed by African Union troops have been conducting operations in Lower Shabelle region pushing the militants from their main strongholds.
