Addis Ababa â€” The newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia Tan Jian said the partnership between Ethiopia and China could be seen as a role model for the South-South cooperation. Tan said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday that the Sino-Ethiopian partnership is a comprehensive one and could be seen as "a role model for the South-South cooperation." "The relationship between Ethiopia and China is based on comprehensive, strategic and cooperative partnership in all areas and at all levels," he said. Describing the economic cooperation as the basis, Tan also stressed cooperation in the human resource development sector and the science and the technology field. "The bond between the two peoples is very important and it should be the foundation for the relationship between China and Ethiopia," Tan said. The newly appointed ambassador also lauded the role of the Ethiopian Airlines in promoting relations of the two countries. He indicated that frequent visits among nationals of the two countries would further strengthen the people-to-people relations between the two countries.

"In the last 20 years, the level of economic cooperation with China has grown very fast. It will facilitate industrial manufacturing development, boost Ethiopia's competitiveness," Shide said.
