South Africa remains fully committed to reducing all forms of pollution, says Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. "As a responsible global citizen, South Africa is committed to addressing pollution at the international, regional and national levels," Minister Molewa said. Addressing the High Level Segment of the Third Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday, she said South Africa's Constitution provides a legal obligation for government to ensure that the environment is safe and clean for all. "This obligation is a core pillar of our National Development Plan (NDP) that sets sustainable development targets to be achieved by 2030. "In line with the NDP, we have developed legislation, policies, strategies and action plans to address air, land, water and marine pollution," Minister Molewa said. The country has also established an Academic Researchers Forum focused on priority pollution problems such as plastic pollution, as well as emerging pollutants of concern. "In line with the country's commitment to concretely address the global challenge of environmental pollution, I am honoured and pleased to announce that South Africa will be joining the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Clean Seas Campaign on Marine Litter aimed at fighting marine plastic litter," she said. South Africa has recently partnered with Rwanda and Nigeria for the Africa Alliance on Circular Economy. This alliance will collaborate with the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy initiative.
