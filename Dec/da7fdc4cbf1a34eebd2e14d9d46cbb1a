Afro-jazz sensation, Memory Chinamasa , has released a single titled Ndinokusuwa,3 which features celebrated producer Oskid. Considering the amount of airplay on the local radio stations at the moment, her partnership with Oskid seems to have created a desirable path for her musical journey. In a recent interview with The Standard Style, the 32-year-old silky-voiced songstress who is backed by The Antiques, said the single is already on the streets for sale. "The single is now available in shops and on the streets. I am happy with the response so far and I hope that it will reach all corners of Zimbabwe," she said. Chinamasa, who is a prison officer, said her single was about a person who badly misses his/her lover. "I wrote the song after seeing what people do and feel after missing their lovers," she said. The song gives advice to those in love and talks about the good value of true love. "Though it feels painful to be missing your lover, the song encourages lovers to practise good relationships and not to be taken away by the ills that affect strong relationships," she said. "Obviously, I am happy to have worked with Oskid and his contribution on the single has been worthwhile. We took our time to come up with this single because we did not want to come up with a half-baked project." Known as Memo in music circles, Chinamasa was born and bred in Mutare. She began her career in Manicaland in 2011 playing in places in and around Mutare and numerous corporate functions. She has performed at Book Caf√© and Bar Rouge at Long Cheng Plaza in Harare. Memo has shared the stage with Oliver Mtukudzi, Victor Kunonga, Steve Makoni and Audius Mtawarira, among other top artists. What drives Chinamasa the most is her passion for music. Her late father used to play different genres and the on-going melodies, rhythms, and harmonies of music that he used to play made her fall in love with music.
