Popular musician Sulumani Chimbetu had alimony fees for his two children with his ex-wife, Marygold Mutemasango reduced from $800 per month to $400 by a Harare magistrate. Magistrate Lazini Ncube on Monday ruled that the musician was not immune to current economic hardships before he slashed the amount by half. "It's not in dispute that things are currently hard for most people in the country now. The applicant cannot be immune to economic hardships besides being prominent. It is also common knowledge that musical shows no longer draw multitudes like before," he said before he granted the application in favour of Chimbetu. This followed an application in which the musician complained that his income has since declined owing to economic hardships. Chimbetu told court that his shows were no longer being attended like before and asked that the fees be slashed. He said he was burdening his current wife who was now forking out money from her salary towards the upkeep of the two children. He was in arrears of $4 400 at the time he applied for downward variation of maintenance. The musician was dragged to court several times on allegations of defaulting paying maintenance fees. Chimbetu has three other children with his wife besides the two he had with Mutemasango. He told court that his ex-wife was doing nothing with regards to searching for employment adding that she frequents places of entertainment while bragging that she has no need to go to work as she is earning more than civil servants. However Mutemasango insisted that Chimbetu was making lots of money through his musical shows. She went on to bring photos of people who attend his shows in a bid to prove her arguments. On December 19 last year at Harare Civil Court, Chimbetu was ordered to pay $800 every month towards the upkeep of his two children. He however appeared twice in court over defaulting payment of maintenance.
