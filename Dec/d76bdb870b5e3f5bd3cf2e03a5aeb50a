In fulfilment of its objective of making sustainable living possible, Unilever Africa, has reinstated the firm's resolve to actualise this vision through its social mission initiatives with focus on the health and wellbeing of people in its community of operations. The company's President, Bruno Witvoet stated this when the company took its Perfect City Community outreach initiative to Ken-Ade Private School in Makoko, community of Lagos. He was joined by other volunteers from Unilever to educate the pupils and teachers of the school about oral hygiene using the Pepsodent Brush + Day night campaign. The community visit forms part of the major pillars of Unilever's Perfect City Outreach. Perfect City is one of Unilever's initiative to drive Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). "Through this initiative, we leverage on community insights to drive inclusive market growth and development while improving livelihood and wellbeing through our brands. In demonstration of this, we have spent quality time at the school educating the children on oral hygiene using our Pepsodent Brush + Night campaign. These children are at the stage of habit formation. If they imbibe the right culture of brushing twice daily, it will significantly reduce oral health issues like cavity." Bruno said. Earlier in his welcome remarks, the proprietor of the school, Bawo Ayeseminikan lauded Unilever for its efforts on sustainable development focused on reaching communities such as Makoko. "With over 450 students in the school, we are pleased to receive your oral hygiene message, especially the practical demonstrations of how to care for our teeth by brushing twice daily. We will continue these teachings and demonstrations as part of our regular health care classes to enable the children cultivate this habit and have healthy teeth and gum," he said.
