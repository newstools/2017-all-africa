Kanye â€” Government has increased donkey carts allowance from P600 to P1 000. Chairperson of the Southern District Council, Mr Alec Seametso, who was officially opening the Southern District Council meeting in Kanye recently said donkey carts transporters had shown less interest in transporting pupils to and from primary schools, citing low remuneration. Government had introduced the donkey cart initiative to cater for transport for those pupils in primary schools travelling long distances to and from schools. He said the increase was a welcome development as it was anticipated that more people would now show interest and eventually more pupils in need of transport would be assisted accordingly. Mr Seametso further said promotion of education at grassroot level was a priority, hence introduction of reception classes in primary schools. He said so far 52 primary schools had reception classes and the plan was to roll out 21 more classes in the year 2018/19, resources permitting. The chairperson noted that the increase was expected to put 630 more learners into reception classes, adding that the major challenge had been shortage of classrooms in schools. He called upon other development partners to assist where possible. "Despite government's efforts to provide education to every school going child, I am disappointed to note that there are still cases of school drop outs recorded in schools, which totals to 157," he said. He said junior secondary schools recorded the highest number of drop outs at 92, followed by primary schools at 35 and senior schools at 30. Mr Seametso stated that the greatest challenge was lack of parental involvement, noting that school leadership had intensified parental involvement by hosting empowerment workshops and meetings. He urged councillors to conduct kgotla meetings and extend meetings to schools so that both parents and children were made aware of the importance of education. Source: BOPA
