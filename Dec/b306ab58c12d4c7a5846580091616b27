It started like a rain drop and now it has become a tidal wave. The clamour for the scrapping of the Special Anti Robbery Squads (SARS) of the Police Force is increasing daily, with allegations against the die-hard squad members for alleged abuse of human rights, brutality, extortion, extra-judicial killings, connivance with criminals and insubordination to higher authority including the regular Police top echelon and the State Governments, wherever the squads are located. To some pro-scrap-SARS agitators, members of the elite squad, which reportedly comprise both military and police personnel have gotten away with too many alleged extra-judicial killings and are becoming too uncontrollable for comfort. However, in an opposing move, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of a popular town in the South-South, insisting on the stay and even expansion of the anti-robbery squad. According to this group, those calling for SARS to be scrapped "are either robbers or have skeletons in their cupboards and are afraid of discovery and exposure". Well, both sides do have their points, but that does not take away the fact that the SARS squads have been accused of serial abuse of human rights, which is enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution. It does not also erase the fact that despite allegations of extra-judicial killings against the squad members, there has been no notable arrest and prosecution of alleged accused squad members. As a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police stated, SARS is a 'contraption' that can be reformed positively. This reporter supports this suggestion; the bad eggs should be flushed out from the squads and the personnel should be drilled on respect for human rights. To truly curb crime in Nigeria, SARS is important, but not at the expense of human rights or lives... .simple truth
