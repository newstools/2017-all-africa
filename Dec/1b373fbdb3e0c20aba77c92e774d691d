#WizkidTheConcert is arguably the best concert of the year. Nigeria's international and local music artistes literally raised the roof with their performances to the delight of the audience. It was, indeed, a dream come true for many fans as they witnessed the headliner, Wizkid, call his "rival" Davido to the stage. In this historic moment, the crowd went wild as they sang Davido's single, FIA. Another highlight of the concert was when 12-year-old Ahmed got signed to Wizkid's label, Starboy Entertainment, with a whopping N10 million for wowing Wizkid and the audience.
