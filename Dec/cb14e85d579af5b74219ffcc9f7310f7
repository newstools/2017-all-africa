Maiduguri — The fate of Mainok, a village on the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway, is hanging in the balance as Nigerian military and Boko Haram insurgents have engaged in a battle for the control of the town. Mainok, a village about 58 kilometres from Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, had suffered its worst attack in September 2014 during which the entire village was razed in an attack by the sect. During the attack, all the residents who survived had to flee to Maiduguri where they formed the first set of organised internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the state which has risen to over two million people. It was just last year that they summoned the courage to return back home after the state government assisted in the rebuilding of the village. However, a security source told THISDAY on the phone at about 8:30p.m. yesterday that the troops from the Nigeria military were involved in a battle with the terrorists in Mainok village, Kaga Local Government Area of the state. A source from within the Nigeria security forces in the state also confirmed that the attackers came through the bush that links Mainok with Buniyadi village in Yobe State, which at a time was one of the strongholds of the insurgents in the troubled region. The source said: "Yes the attack is on as I speak with you now. But our troops are gallantly tackling them as we continue to monitor news from the area. "The insurgents came through the Buniyadi axis that connects to Kaga local government ànd Sambisa forest." When contacted on the attack, the spokesman of the police in Borno State, Victor Isuku, said news of the attack was still sketchy, promising to get the details immediately something concrete comes up.
