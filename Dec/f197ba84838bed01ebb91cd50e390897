Kitui â€” Kitui Governor Kaluki Ngilu has opened discussions with the Indian High Commissioner to Kenya Suchitra Durai on possible collaborations between the County and the Indian Government towards actualisation of her five- pillar Manifesto. In particular, Ngilu explored market opportunities for green grams already being produced under the Ndengu Revolution, her flagship project for food and wealth creation. Ngilu has provided farmers with the seeds and is expecting 40 metric tonnes of yield. She pitched for broad based co-operation to access Indian technology with a view to transferring this technology for the benefit of Kitui County. The governor also explored opportunities in development of the cottage industry to help Kitui create jobs and add value to all agricultural products of the county. The High Commissioner expressed her willingness to collaborate with the Governor and the fields of irrigation, training and creating linkages that would help Kitui have an empowered community capable of feeding themselves. Durai accepted an invitation from Ngilu to visit Kitui and see first hand the challenges and opportunities existing in the county and at the same time grow firm foundations for co-operation. Governor Ngilu's manifesto targets Food and water, Heath care, Education and Youth Development, Women Empowerment and Wealth Creation.
