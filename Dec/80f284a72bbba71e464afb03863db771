Cape Town — New African Magazine has announced its list of Africa's most influential people for 2017. In an article on the magazine's website, Omar Ben Yedder, group publisher and managing director of IC Publications, says: "What our readers will find pleasing is the almost bewildering diversity of this list -  in terms of race, ethnic and national diversity. This list, if nothing else, displays the beauty and power of the diversity that makes the Africa we all love." The list, which profiles both continental and Diasporan Africans nominated by their peers and industry insiders, covers eight categories: There are 42 women on the list - the highest number since the magazine began publishing the list five years ago With 21 entries, Nigeria tops the nominations, closely followed by South Africa with 14 names. In total the list includes entries from 31 countries including 12 from Francophone Africa. "Our criteria for 'influential' this year was a fairly simple one – it is applied to people whose work or activity has had some sort of transformative effect outside their main calling. This effect results in a change of perception or provides inspiration to others. Many in our selection have shattered the proverbial glass-ceilings or disability stigma and do so with great bravery, determination and personal sacrifice. Others yield economic power that impacts world markets," said editor Anver Versi.
