Khartoum â€” The Foreign Minister, Prof. Ibrahim Ghandour, has denounced the negative reaction of some of the Egyptian media on the visit of the Turkish President's visit to Sudan. At a joint press conference with the visiting Turkish Foreign Minister, Prof. Ghandour said that we do hold all the Egyptian people guilty, but it appeared that there are some people who do not understand how the relations between nations are being managed. He indicated that these Egyptian media elements would have tackle the issue of the Turkish President's visit if such a visit was not very successful and very important. Responding to a question on engagement of a regional alliance with Qatar, Turkey and Iran, the Foreign Minister affirmed that Sudan was and will never be a party in alliance and does believe on the policy of alliances. He stressed that Sudan is open to its peace-loving brothers and friends all over world for realizing the common interests and the international peace and security.
