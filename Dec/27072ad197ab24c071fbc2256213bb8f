Yola â€” Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said the Federal Government will seek permanent solution to the clashes between herders and farming communities. Speaking yesterday in Numan during a visit to some of the villages raided by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herders, Osinbajo said he understood that the clashes resulted from long running misunderstanding which had not been tackled. "My visit to Adamawa state is to begin a process that would solve this problem once and for all. We must seek definite and permanent solution to this crisis," he said. Calling for caution and use of dialogue to resolve communal issues, Osinbajo restated the resolve of the government to proffer lasting solution to the problem. "This is human problem. It is not caused by spirit, so it must have human solution," he said. The traditional ruler of Bachama Chiefdom, Honest Irmiya Stephen who regretted the lingering crisis in his domain called for deployment of additional security personnel to the area to protect lives and property. He appealed for re-establishment of the Area Command of the Nigerian Police which was removed from the town in 2009. Speaking during Osinbajo's visit to Dong village, the Paramount Ruler of Demsa, Hama Bata, Gladson Alhamdu Teneke said 48 people were buried while scores were missing or injured in the attack. The police spokesperson, Abubakar Othman who had earlier said the police were working to ascertain the actual number of the dead could not be reached for update as at the time of filing this report.
