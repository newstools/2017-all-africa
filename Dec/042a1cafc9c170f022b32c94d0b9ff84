"Following our highly successful outing in 'Orange September,' a series of events organised to commemorate the 30th anniversary of our dear state." "The Ministry of Culture and Tourism under my supervision has decided to undertake another major event in our conscious and regular efforts to further stamp the state as a tourism destination. "As we all know, yuletide periods in the state have hitherto been bereft of hyped activities. "During this period we usually witness an outflow of human traffic into neighbouring states as indigenes and fun seekers leave the state in their numbers to other parts of the country in search of entertainment and recreation." "It is in an attempt to remedy this and spice up the yuletide experience for the citizens of Akwa Ibom State, while effectively marketing our huge tourist potentials that the Ministry has decided to host "Ukap'isua." "We hope to create during this same period, a unique experience that will not only create recreation and entertainment, but also market our huge tourism potentials," Antai said. He explained that "Ukap'isua would commence with the opening of the festival village, located at the auspicious Ibom Unity Park, Udoudoma Avenue, Uyo.
