Seyi Shay has been in the news recently for two reasons: Her shockingly enlarged bum which she has openly appreciated and her new single titled Bia. While we await her concert which is billed to happen later this month, Bia is her little gift tease to us. The song which is an Afro pop hit with salsa influence will definitely spice up your morning. Enjoy! Seyi Shay is an international Nigerian-based musician who has written hit songs and has an album to her name titled Seyi or Shey.
