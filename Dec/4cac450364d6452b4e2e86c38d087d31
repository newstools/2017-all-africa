Nairobi â€” Foreign diplomats on Friday morning met with NASA leaders led by Raila Odinga where they reiterated the need for him to engage in open and transparent national conversation to address underlying issues. The diplomats led by US envoy Robert Godec and the British High Commissioner Nic Hailey say such kind of dialogue will strengthen institutions to help the country. The meeting also attended by religious and business leaders emphasised the need for all parties across the political divide to respect and uphold the Constitution. "Religious and business leaders and diplomats met NASA leaders today. Urged government, opposition and all Kenyans to engage in open, transparent national conversation to address underlying issues & strengthen institutions to help Kenya. Stress need to uphold Constitution," Ambassador Godec said on his Twitter handle. The sentiments come ahead of the planned swearing-in of Odinga on Jamhuri Day, with Attorney General Githu Muigai saying it is outside the confines of the Constitution and qualifies as high treason. Muigai stated that it would be a treasonable offence to swear-in Odinga as President without him having been declared winner of an election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and absence of the presence of the Chief Justice. High treason, he stated, attracts the death penalty.
