Brian Ahumuza celebrated the fifth anniversary of his Abryanz Style and Fashion Awards at a sold-out event at Kampala Serena hotel last Friday. The Ciroc sponsored event attracted guests from South African, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and the hosts Uganda among others. This year's theme was 'Fashion Take Over' with focus on helping fashion designers to turn their creativity into a business. Ahumuza said the awards had accomplished its main goal of bringing together Africans from all walks of life in one place with the purpose of celebrating Africa's outstanding fashion. "The ASFAs made five years in existence this year with a groundbreaking milestone by being the only fashion event in the country to sell out," he said. Music and fashion blended with showcases from Nigeria's Mai Atafo, UK-based Ugandan Alecool, Tanzania's Sheria Ngowi, Sheeba Kassami Pemba and Monica Kansiime. Fik Fameika, Latinum, Nutty Neithan, Sheebah and Mafikizolo performed.
