President Jacob Zuma has extended his heartfelt condolences on the passing of veteran musician, Mr Robbie Malinga, who passed on yesterday, 25 December 2017 on Christmas day. Mr Malinga's rise to fame coincided with the increasing popularity of kwaito music in the 1990's. He played a role in shaping the genre. "We are deeply saddened by the loss of such a talented artist. This is indeed a huge loss for South Africa and the music industry as a whole. We are with his family in thoughts and prayers during this trying period. May his soul rest in peace," President Zuma said. Issued by: The Presidency
