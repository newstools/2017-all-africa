Kisumu â€” Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company (KIWASCO) will on Monday appoint an acting Managing Director to run the water company on a temporary basis. This is after the current MD, Engineer David Onyango who has been at the helm of the company for the last 11 years, stated that he will not be requesting for a renewal of his contract. KIWASCO Board Chairman Israel Agina has confirmed that the MD sent a request to the board requesting to proceed on terminal leave and not renew his contract that ends in March next year. "The board considered the request and approved it subsequently releasing him, on Monday we shall be appointing acting MD pending recruitment of a substantive Managing Director early next year," Agina said. Speaking to the press in Kisumu, Agina says Onyango made several strides at KIWACO that has seen the connection of tapped clean water to both residential and commercial setups. He says KIWASCO despite challenges has managed to increase water connectivity amidst a growing population in the lakeside city.
