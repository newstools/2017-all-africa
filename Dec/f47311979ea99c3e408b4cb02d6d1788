THE United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) believes that Tanzania can bring positive changes in the industrial sector since it has enough resources, raw materials and manpower to support the plan. UNIDO has also promised to continue supporting the government to fulfill its goals to establish, revive and build up an industrial based economy. The organisation's National Programme Officer, Mr Gerald Runyoro said during the ongoing industrial exhibitions at Mwalimu Nyerere grounds along Kilwa road that UNIDO will continue to support the government through offering education and other related support. The exhibitions have been organised for the second time by the Tanzania Trade Development Authority (TanTrade). "Tanzania has enough raw materials to support establishment and development of industries, UNIDO believes the fifth government's plan and ambitions to develop industries are achievable," he noted. However, Mr Runyoro asked the government to set strong strategies that will help to protect local industries and make sure the already established industries observe rules, principles and regulations of protecting environment. The Tantrade Board Chairman, Mr Christopher Chizza asked investors and owners of industries to put more efforts in the expansion of industries and offering education to the public on the importance of establishing industries and consuming local made products. Mr Chizza added that there is need to strengthen the existing industries, ensure reliable supply of water, electricity and other required materials.
