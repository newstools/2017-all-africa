Abuja â€” THE Nigerian government has warned disgruntled soldiers from collaborating with agents allegedly bent on compromising the fight against the Boko Haram terror group. This follows the Ministry of Defence alleging government had received credible information on sponsored campaigns of defamation against the military leadership by some unscrupulous members of society. The alleged campaign seeks to portray troops as failing to eliminate the Boko Haram and the terror groups having an upper hand. It is believed the alleged campaign is aimed at smearing the name and rubbishing the efforts of the government at fighting the menace of Boko Haram, which has killed thousands during a decade-long terror spree while more than three million others displaced. The Nigerian government alleges the unscrupulous elements were aiming to sponsor interviews with some front line soldiers to portray that the troops morale was low due to poor management of resources and administration. It has been previously reported troops lacked motivation because of poor working conditions and salaries. Colonel Tukur Ismail Gusau, spokesperson of the defence enjoined officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces to continue to be law abiding and dedicated to their duties. "Anyone that allows himself to be used by these unscrupulous elements will have himself to blame," Gusau said. Boko Haram has also caused unrest in the rest of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region's member states.
