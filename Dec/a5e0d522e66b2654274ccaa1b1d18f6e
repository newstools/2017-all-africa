One person died and nine others were injured on Thursday morning after a truck lost control and fell on top of two cars, and then crashed into three others on the M7 in Durban. Rescue Care's operations director, Garrith Jamieson, said it appeared the truck's load had shifted after it went around a corner, and that the driver then lost control of the vehicle. He said the truck landed on two cars and crashed into three others. "At this stage, there is one person who has passed away and two people... entrapped in the wreckage with multiple other casualties," he said. Jamieson said the Durban fire department and advanced life support paramedics from Rescue Care were working to free the people who were trapped. Source: News24
