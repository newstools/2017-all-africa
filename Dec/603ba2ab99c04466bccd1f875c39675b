Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander, General Constantino Chiwenga, is reportedly earmarked for one of the country's two deputy president posts ahead of Zanu-PF's extraordinary congress. Chiwenga was widely believed to have orchestrated the military takeover which resulted in former president Robert Mugabe resigning after 37 years in power.
