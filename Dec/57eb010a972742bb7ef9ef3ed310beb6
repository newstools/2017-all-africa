Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has shared more photos of his stay in Germany where he has been nursing his ailing wife, Pauline. In his latest photos, Kalonzo shared a meal with Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior and the wiper leader's son. Kalonzo has been missing in political action since his wife, Pauline was flown to Germany for specialised treatment. He maintained a low profile while abroad until when co-principal Moses Wetangula, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Turkana's Josphat Nanok visited him two weeks ago. ODM Communication Director Philip Etale had indicated that Raila Odinga would visit Kalonzo before his grand homecoming last week but that never came to pass. Kenyans online have been praying for Pauline's quick recovery with some encouraging Kalonzo in his latest Facebook post. Lucas Leana wrote, "Mhesh Kalonzo in heart and Prayers we are together, you will overcome this in the Mighty Name of the Most High.Wish our Mum Quick Recovery!" Alphonce Muthami commented, "I personally sympathize with what you are going through but remember the God we worship is a trustworthy God. Everything is under control in hands of the Lord! Quick recovery #Mum". Benjamin Rangala wrote, "Truly sorry my VP... I wish mama a quick recovery... meanwhile tunaapisha Baba tarehe kumi na mbili December... ikifika kama hauko nitakuletea bibilia German tumalize ii maneno once n 4 al." Duncan Ndegwa commented, "Quick recovery to your wife. May God bless you sir. Indeed you are a great man. Standing strong on her side. You are in our thoughts and prayers. It is well. Shalom." Waithira Karakacha added, "Quick recovery to madam Pauline, I guess that's what is most important for now,, may God meet with you at the point of all needs."
