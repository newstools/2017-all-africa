Enugu â€” Residents of Ninth Mile Corner in Udi Local Council of Enugu State are worried over indiscriminate parking of articulated vehicles along major roads in the area. They said this has been causing gridlock and accidents along the route. Trucks, parked on both sides of the road leading to a major brewery in the area, are used for the haulage of its products by contractors of the company to their destinations. These vehicles have continued to compound the woes of road users, who spend time maneuvering the area, said residents.At the weekend, one of the trucks lost control while attempting to meander its way through a narrow space, and rammed into shops. It destroyed buildings and goods worth several millions of naira. Eyewitnesses, who said the owner of the shop escaped by a whisker, disclosed that it was not the first time such incident occurs. Chioma Igwe, a restaurant operator in the area, told The Guardian said: "these vehicles have constituted public nuisance and exposed residents to great danger." Perturbed by the incident, outgoing Transition Committee Chairman of the Local Council, Sheddy Ozoene, has petitioned the Senate on what he described as "sustained damage to public facilities and continued pollution of the environment within Ninth Mile Corner and its environment by the haulage operators of the company". The petition dated November 14 and addressed to the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges had lamented the non- provision of parks for the articulated vehicles by the company for these articulated vehicles. Meanwhile, a former member of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Chika Eneh, commended the move by the outgoing council chairman to get attention to the Ninth Mile axis. She said such measure would ensure free vehicular movement during the festive season and beyond.
