As unemployment persists in the country, youths have been advised to embrace entrepreneurship to contribute to national development. This position was canvassed by a co-founder and Vice President of Fate Foundation, Austin Okere, while addressing the graduating class of AEP 58, 59, 60,61 and EEP 20 and 21, during the its 2017 annual celebration tagged: The Future of Entrepreneurship, which held yesterday at the Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos. Okere advised the graduands to take entrepreneurship and job creation seriously. "I believe that it is through entrepreneurship that we can accelerate job creation and national development. There is no better time than now to seriously consider and undertake your own entrepreneurial journeys. The immense support systems available today cannot be overemphasised," he said. While speaking on Risk Taking And Conquering Fear As An Entrepreneur, he recounted his personal experience of how he left his well paying job to start his own company. He explained that although he faced different trials and disappointments at the time, his aspiration and need to impact the world pushed him to achieve success. In his words: "In order to reach your potential as a leader, you have to discover your passion and fully key into it. This may involve taking some risks and making bold changes. "The process involves learning, unlearning and relearning as you go along. The things we fear the most in life are not necessarily our adversities but the fear of our anxieties and what others think about us."
