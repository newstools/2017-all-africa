The newly inaugurated President of the Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), Mr. Akinola Olawore has promised to ensure sustained economic ties between the UK and Nigeria. According to a statement, Olawore said this while speaking at a dinner organised to honour him as the 15th president of the Chamber in Lagos recently. The presidential dinner was designed to celebrate the organisation, highlight its proposed direction for growth and to witness the official baton change whilst also bringing together its esteemed members, dignitaries in society, corporate leaders, diplomats and technocrats from various sectors of the economy. Olawore also emphasised the need to continually sustain relationship in building critical infrastructure much needed in the country. Delivering his keynote address for the evening titled "How Nigeria can restore to Growth and Prosperity?" the guest speaker, Mr. Olabode Agusto, highlighted four major principles which he deemed as necessary for effectively managing any economy. These he highlighted to include growing output per person in real terms, creating employment, growing the tax base and tax revenue and ensuring price stability. According to Agusto, the government must rise up to the challenges faced in providing for the needy within the community, securing lives and providing basic services for the citizens. He then called for the increase in productivity across agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors of the economy. According to him, there are limited resources to cater for the ever-demanding needs of Nigeria's growing population. To this end, he said there was need to improve the finances of the government, particularly the federal government. Furthermore, Agusto called for the reduction of domestic borrowing by the federal government.
