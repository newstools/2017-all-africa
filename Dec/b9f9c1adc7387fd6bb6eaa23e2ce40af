CAF President Ahmad has sent a message of condolence to the president of the Normalisation Committee following the death of Benjamin Massing, who passed away on Sunday, 10 December 2017. A Cameroon international during the 80's and 90's, he was a member of the Class of 1990, that shone at the FIFA World Cup in Italy. He is fondly remembered for his physical play during the opening match against a Diego Maradona-led Argentina, which Cameroon won 1-0. After a playing career in Cameroon, Massing left for France where he played for Cr√©teil and Le Havre. He was 55.
