Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. government's Bureau of African Affairs Donald Yamamoto has warned that the National Super Alliance's plan to swear in opposition leader Raila Odinga as the "people's president" will only fuel tension in the country. Yamamoto is expected to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta in his push to initiate dialogue, and perhaps then meet the opposition.
