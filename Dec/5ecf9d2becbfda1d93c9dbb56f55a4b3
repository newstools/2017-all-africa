Sexy Kenyan songbird, Victoria Kimani has broken up with her hunky Nigerian boyfriend Stanley Obiamalu, who is a video producer and director. Victoria, who is known to be highly secretive about her love life, made the revelation of the split during an interview with a local TV station. "Honestly, I feel like a virgin right now, my love life has actually been non-existent. I've not been in a relationship for like six months now and I haven't tried to bother like to try find someone else" Victoria said during the interview. She went on to say she doesn't intend to date a celebrity in future, terming it as a bad idea since she has tried it and it did not turn out well. 'CHINA LOVE' Since bursting into fame some few years ago, Victoria managed to conceal her love life until last year when she introduced her Nigerian boyfriend to the world following rumours that she was dating Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama. It was on her 32nd birthday party last year in South Africa that she brought the speculations to an end by revealing the identity of her boyfriend with whom she now broken up. The breakup comes at a time Victoria, who rarely performs in Kenya due to her song's popularity outside the country, is riding high with her hit single China Love.
