The President of Uganda Medical Association (UMA) of doctors, Dr Ekwaro Obuku has been admitted to hospital after being attacked by suspected thugs on Wednesday night. Dr Obuku who recently led doctors in all government hospitals to strike over low salary was reportedly attacked at the gate of his home. In a telephone interview this morning, UMA's spokesperson, Dr Brian Kasagga told this reporter that following the attack, Dr Obuku sustained some injuries in the base of the skull especially nasal area and bled a lot from the mouth and nose. "However, he is stable and conscious. He awaits evaluation from a Neuro Surgeon," Kasagga said. When asked to which hospital Dr Obuku is admitted, Dr Kasagga said he cannot reveal it for security reasons. He also declined to reveal where the attack happened saying: "He has many places but for security reasons, it's not good to disclose. We aren't sure whether they were robbers, kifeesi or people with other intentions." However, Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson Luke Owesigyira says Dr Obuku was attacked at his home in Kitikifumba, Kiira Division at about 11pm. "It is alleged that Dr Ekwaro Obuku was attacked at his gate as he waited for it to be opened and his phone was robbed in that same area," says Mr Owesigyira.
