A 54-year-old woman has died while her daughter, 22, has been rushed to hospital after a horrific accident involving two trucks and a motor vehicle in Durban on Monday morning, paramedics say. Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care spokesperson, said the deceased was a passenger in a car that was being driven by her daughter. The accident happened on Bellair Road near Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Cato Manor at about 08:30. Jamieson said the daughter was trapped in her vehicle for nearly an hour and a half after the collision. Firefighters had to use the Jaws of Life to free her, he said. "She was rushed to a nearby hospital in a serious but stable condition," he said. Both drivers of the trucks sustained minor injuries, he added. Source: News24
