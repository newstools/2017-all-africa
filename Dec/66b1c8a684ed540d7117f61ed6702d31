Awka â€” A renowned Nollywood actor, Chief Obi Okoli, has called for the establishment of a film village in Anambra to launch the state among the frontline states where movies were made. He said situating a film village in Anambra, the flagship of the south-east, would go a long way in creating more employment for the teeming youths as well as the aged. Speaking to newsmen after touring the world class digital studios of the Anambra Broadcasting Service, in Awka, Okoli recalled those days when films were produced abroad, expressing joy that the movie industry has blossomed remarkably in the country. The veteran actor and a lecturer of Theater Arts, at the University of Nigeria Nsukka, Okoli, who applauded the undaunted improvement and innovations in Nollywood, however expressed regrets over the commercialization emphasis prevalent in the industry. "Commercialization has remained the bane of the industry as many producers aim more at making profit. There is need for we in the industry to cherish more of the act and the message behind the movies for a better society," he said.
