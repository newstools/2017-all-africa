The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) in collaboration with other organization has empowered indigent women including those living with HIV/AIDS. A statement from the agency yesterday said 52 women benefitted from the programme which was aimed at promoting entrepreneurships and income generation through acquisition of skills among vulnerable women and girls in Nigeria. "The goal of this initiative is to economically empower fifty (50) vulnerable and indigent women and girls thereby contributing towards ending violence against women and girls in Nigeria. Expected results include establishing sustainable income generation activities for groups of HIV vulnerable women and girls in Nigeria and to improve their economic status," the statement said. NACA with funding from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNFPA partnered with the Network of Women Living with HIV in Nigeria, other Civil Society Organizations and the Abuja Enterprise Agency to train women as part of activities to mark this year's 16 Days activism against Gender-Based Violence.
