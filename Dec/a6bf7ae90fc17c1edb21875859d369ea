The Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat, Mrs Amanda Pam, has said that the FCT School of Nursing and Midwifery lacks necessary infrastructure to "improve the quality of its graduands." Pam said since the establishment of the institutions in 1981, the infrastructure in place was nothing to write home about. She therefore inaugurated a nine-man committee to examine the challenges militating against the institution's growth. A statement by the secretariat's spokesman, Badaru Yakasai, said Pam inaugurated the committee after she paid an unscheduled visit to the school. She was quoted to have urged the committee to investigate the problems that are retarding the growth and development of the institution. She told the members of the committee, headed by the Director, Administration and Finance of FCT Health Management Board, Mrs Justina Maimagani, to review the methods of selection of intakes and placement of suitably qualified candidates into the institution. They are also to recommend the need for the institution's expansion in terms of curriculum. She urged them to involve technocrats with requisite knowledge for successful execution of their assignment and to conclude it within four weeks. Responding on behalf of other members of the committee, the chairperson Mrs Maimagani, thanked the secretary for the confidence reposed in them and expressed their readiness to complete the assignment on schedule.
