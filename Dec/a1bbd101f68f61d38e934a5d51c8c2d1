Level 6 water restrictions will kick-in on January 1, 2018. Urban households are required to reduce water usage by 45%, and agricultural users to reduce consumption by 60%. However, individual households with more than four occupants, or people with specific health requirements, need to apply to the City for an increase in the minimum water allocated.
