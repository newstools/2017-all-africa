Nairobi â€” University lecturers and their employers will on Monday go back to the negotiating table for talks on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The meeting between the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) and universities management will also be attended by officials of the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE). "This is to invite you to a meeting of the Joint Negotiations Committee of the Inter Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF), the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) and the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU)," a letter signed by the Joint Negotiations Committee Chairman Isaac Mbeche stated. According to a return-to-work formula that was signed by the union's Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga and Vice-Chancellors Committee Chairman Francis Aduol last week, the talks are supposed to be concluded by the 31st of next month. The deal was signed last week after a one-month strike that paralysed learning at 31 public universities. This followed the release of Sh2 billion by the government for the payment of enhanced salaries and house allowances for lecturers while some Sh3.1 billion will be released in seven months for the 2013-2017 CBA. They also agreed that all pending internal 2013-2017 CBAs for individual universities will now be concluded by February 28. The accrued pension stands at Sh4 billion - Sh2 billion for the 2010-2013 CBA and Sh2 billion for 2013-2017.
