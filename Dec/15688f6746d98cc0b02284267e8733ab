Going through the streets in Nigeria, you could easily see hardship and hunger boldly written on the faces of some Nigerians, especially as the country recently witnessed a recession that caused numbers of square meals disappearing on the tables of many homes. It is on this note that former Nollywood actor, Williams Uchemba, has decided to throw some smiles on the faces of some poor Nigerians, especially those who have defied the hardship to keep on pushing through legitimate struggles to keep food on their tables. The following video clips show Mr. Uchemba who now shuttles between Nigeria and the United States of America come home with some real cash to help poor Nigerians have a happy celebration in this Christmas season. Giving reasons for the kind gesture, the 2002 Best Kid Actor in Nigeria award winner said he is starting a challenge tagged #givechallenge this season " to everyone on the street to help them have a good holiday as most of them can't make ends meet." He called on popular musicians and celebrities to join th challenge and make poor Nigerians happy. What do you say?
