Diamond Platinumz and Zari Hassan were over the weekend the best couple during the wedding of their cousin DJ Rommy Jones. The couple attended the Arab-themed Nikkah on Friday before dazzling in blue during the white wedding. When the two shared photos of the wedding, fans asked them to get married as well while others commented how the best couple should be people who are married. Moleli_jackline commented, "Mie nimechoka best man wa natakiwa wawe wanandoa siyo wazinzi msitie mikosi kwenye ndoa za watu."

Zari had not confirmed her Tanzania travel until late last week when she surprised her fans with photos of her in her baby daddy's hood. Diamond's mother Sandra kept praising Zari in the run up to Rommy's wedding calling her the real deal. Rommy and Diamond's mothers are sisters and the two brought up their sons together in Tandale. Diamond was offered his first radio airtime by Rommy who by then was a presenter. Rommy is now Diamond's official DJ during music tours.
