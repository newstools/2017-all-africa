Enugu â€” An Ethiopian Airline flight from Addis Ababa to Enugu could not land at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport yesterday, due to bad weather. The flight was forced to make return back to Ethiopia with passengers. Daily Trust gathered that passengers onboard the Ethiopian Ariline expressed anxiety and were said to have protested the development, an official of the Akanu Ibiam airport who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent. It was gathered that the flight was scheduled to land at the Enugu airport by 3pm but due to bad weather it made quick 'u-turn' and flew back to Ethiopia. The airline later checked all the passengers into a hotel in Ethiopia, according to the airport official. "There was protest but it was not much. The airline checked them into a hotel in Ethiopia, and explained to them the risk and I think they appreciated it," the source said. About six flights comprising local and international flights scheduled for Saturday at the Enugu airport were also unsuccessful due to the hazy, harmattan weather, Daily Trust was informed. The source could not recall the exact number of the passengers on board the Ethiopian airline nor could he remember the registration number. "I know it's a big Boeing aircraft. You know that international aircraft are usually big. The offices have closed now and the staff are gone, especially today being Sunday. But I know it's a very big aircraft," he said. When our correspondent visited the airport yesterday, there were fewer activities, as visibility was poor. Mr Ikechi Uko, the Publicist for Ethiopian Airlines said if the entire Enugu airport was shut to traffic due to bad weather, ET couldn't have landed. On why the Captain didn't divert to Lagos or Abuja rather than return to Addis he said that "was a Captain's decision."
