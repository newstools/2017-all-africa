Kenya's youth advocate, Raphael Obonyo, has clinched the 2017 Pan African Humanitarian Award. Mr Obonyo was awarded the coveted prize last week at the Pan African Humanitarian Summit, in Dar es Salaam. The award recognizes the impact of Mr Obonyo's work on social leadership, youth empowerment and his persistence in voicing out youth issues development in Africa.

This, they said, had gone a long way to instill socio-economic stability in thousands of youths, create employment opportunities in the informal Jua Kali sectors, and to minimizing poverty and criminal activities.
