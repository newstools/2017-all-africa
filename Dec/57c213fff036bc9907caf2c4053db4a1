Cabinet has congratulated Miss South Africa, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, on being crowned Miss Universe at the 66th installation of the pageant, held recently in the United States of America. The 22-year-old beauty is from the coastal town of Sedgefield in the Western Cape. Nel-Peters became the second South African to win the title after Margaret Gardiner won the title in 1978. Nel-Peters competed against 91 contestants from around the globe, the biggest number of entrants in the history of the competition. "Our nation is immensely proud of Ms Nel-Peters for this tremendous achievement. She has hoisted the South African flag higher and continues to inspire many young women who look up to her to reach even higher for their dreams. "We congratulate her most heartily and wish her all the best during her reign which is South Africa's reign," said President Jacob Zuma.
