Nairobi women in a popular Facebook group have been racking their brains on a somewhat important matter: How come their men get sudden, unexplainable hard-ons? The matter was discussed extensively in the Chit Chat for Nairobi Mums Facebook group, with members giving varied explanation on why men get erections every time they see their lovers. The debate was ignited after a devastated mum posed: "Hi mamis, is it normal for your guy to keep erecting any second ako around you. Mine amezidi." Hundreds of women shared experiences as they tried to help a sister out. One wrote; "Simply means the kind of effect you have on him is superb."

Another needed tips; "Hahahaa... tell him to tell me the secret. I want my man to apply it." Another wrote; "Give me his number, I will prescribe medication. Meanwhile he loves you." A member tossed the query to an issue of the wallet; "I suspect he's broke and idle. Busy men don't have the energy to erect all the time."
