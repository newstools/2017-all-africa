THE work for the proposed Arusha- Musoma Highway which will pass through Loliondo, has started with the Mto-wa- Mbu to Sale section on the Arusha side. The construction of the road was among issues that were discussed during the Regional Road Board Meeting held at the Arusha Regional Headquarters here, where it was explained that the first phase (49 kilometres) of the road work will cost 87 billion/-, although the whole project which is supposed to cover over 200 kilometres will be accomplished in 2020. The Contractor, 'China Wu Yi Company Limited,' is expected to undertake the task for the next 24 months from now, according to the Regional Manager for Tanzania Road Networks Agency (TANROADS), Engineer Jonny De Kalupale. "All the workers' camps and operating bases have been set up, and at the moment the Chinese firm is waiting for machinery and other construction facilities to be cleared at the Dar es Salaam Port," he revealed, adding that they will start with the first 49 kilometres before proceeding. The distance from Arusha City to Loliondo is 362 kilometres, but since the construction of the road to Wasso starts at Kigongo-Inn junction of Mtowa-- Mbu, the work will cover a 215 kilometres stretch in total. Passing through Mtowa- Mbu, Engaruka, Mount Oldonyo L'engai, Enkaresero Village, Lake Natron and part of Digo-Digo Ward in Monduli, Longido and Ngorongoro districts, the proposed tarmac road is described to be of high economic and social benefits to residents of Arusha and Mara regions. The road is just part of the ambitious track way project meant to connect Arusha and Musoma via Loliondo and Serengeti. The eastern stretch of 214 kilometres' tarmac road will be constructed from Mto wa Mbu to the Wasso section of Loliondo, and this will be joined with the western stretch tarmac road that will be constructed between Makutano- Natta-Mugumu, a distance of 117 kilometres on the Mara side. There will also be a stretch of 12 kilometres from Mugumu to the Western border of the Serengeti National Park.
