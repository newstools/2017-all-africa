Gospel music lovers from the city of Midlands are in for a rare treat this festive season as top gospel musicians Blessing Shumba and Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave are set to perform tomorrow at Mkoba Stadium. The show dubbed Midlands Gospel Extragavanza will also feature an array of artistes including veteran musician Mechanic Manyeruke, Mathias Mhere and Olinda Marowa. Several church choirs including Heartfelt, UFIC, PHD, ZAOGA, Anglican, Methodist, Christ Embassy among others will also take turns to serenade fans. The Mutare-based musician Shumba is currently riding high with the plug song "My Season" off his latest offering "My Season". Shumba who last staged a show in Gweru two years ago said he will be rekindling romance with his fans. "I am so excited to visit Gweru again after a long time. This show is meant to reignite my connection with my fans in this city and I am looking forward to having a great time with them. I will deliver songs from the latest album as well as my yesteryear hits that will take them down memory lane," he said. For Mashavave who has been keeping a low profile for some time now, this becomes her first live show since launching her latest album "Healing Devotion" that is still gaining ground on the market. The new album carries tracks such as "Burukai", "Sunungura", "Ndichagara" and "Sauro Pauro". Mhere who is familiar with Gweru promised to give a polished act as well as Marowa who has not held shows in a while. In an interview the event organiser Makina Muchemei said the show is a Christmas package for Gweru residents. "We have come to the end of year and we ought to thank God that is why I decided to come up with this show. It is meant to unite Christians across all denominations through music as our residents rarely host events of this nature. It will also be an opportunity for the musicians to mix and mingle with their fans," he said.
