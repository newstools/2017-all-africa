Kenyans online noticed something interesting about the denim trousers worn by the Deputy President William Ruto during the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup final. The DP spotted a stripped blue and grey polo shirt, blue jeans and red sneakers during the match between Kenya and Zanzibar on Sunday in Machakos county. But what caught the attention of most Kenyans online was a razor sharp iron line on the front of his jeans. Normally, most pants made from fabric of other texture are ironed by being folded with one leg overlapping the other, to bring out a pressed line running downwards from the waistband on the front and at the back. This is, however, not the case for denim pants whose legs are ironed separately while laid flat on an iron board to avoid the pressed line at the front and and in the back. FASHION MISHAP The DP's fashion mishap has become the subject of discussion on social media with many users playing fashion police. @IanMarkKimani tweeted, "Mwenye anapigia my fren jeans pasi Mungu anakuona." @HellenKadenge said, "Sema Ku colour clash... ?!!! Wapi fashion police?" @AnwarsadatMC wrote, "HAAAAA HAPANA JEANS HAIPIGWI PASI KAMA LONGI YA MATERIAL BABA NOO." @Jontae254 asked, "Pasi ni ya nini kwa jeans?" @Justus_Walobwa noted, "On this am happy today. You did good to come support our home team Harambee Stars and even promise them Kshs 5m. Congratulations Sir. But kindly stop ironing your denim trousers like this." @Steven_Titus001 said, "Hahaha kwani imepigwa pass mguu moja."
