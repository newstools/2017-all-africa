Security agencies have reportedly held strategy meetings on handling National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga's swearing-in event after recent criticism over the use of excessive force. Odinga says his swearing-in on December 12, will be based on the results of the August 8 presidential election, which he claims he won but was "rigged" through the manipulation of figures.
