Nairobi â€” Activist Okiya Omtatah has successfully stopped the offloading, on Kenya, of 25,500 metric tonnes of sugar imported from Brazil. The High Court granted the temporary prohibitory order on Wednesday pending the hearing and determination of the suit. Justice John Mativo ordered that the sugar aboard the MV Holy, should not be processed, cleared or released pending the hearing and determination of the case. "The respondents should not whether by themselves, through their employees or agents or any person claiming to act under their authority, offload the sugar," Mativo ruled. In the petition that names the South Nyanza Sugar Company as a respondent, the Kenya Revenue Authority as the second and Treasury Cabinet Secretary as the third, Okiya wants them stopped from offloading the consignment which docked at the Mombasa port last week. In the petition Omtatah has said if the company is allowed to sell the sugar in the country it would disenfranchise the country's cane farmers and equates it to dumping.
