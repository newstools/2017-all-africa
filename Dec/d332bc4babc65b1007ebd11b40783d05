Sorry guys, Kenyan musician Cece Sagini is off the market. The I Am A Doer singer walked down the aisle on Friday with her photographer fiancé, Victor Peace. Cece made the announcement two days after her big day on her Instagram account. She had during an interview stated that her wedding will be private with only family and close friends. Cece ditched secular music for gospel hits in November when she announced her salvation during a TV interview. The singer got engaged last year after a surprise organised and executed during her interview on NTV's The Trend. 1.12.2017 😍 @meetthepeaces #meetthepeaces 📷 by @smilez_photography_kenya A post shared by Cece Sagini | #Cece🌀nAMission (@cecesagini) on Dec 3, 2017 at 11:52pm PST 1.12.2017😘 love them to bits 😘 #meetthepeaces @meetthepeaces 📷: @smilez_photography_kenya , 👗 Dresses: @sarakaray 😊 A post shared by Cece Sagini | #Cece🌀nAMission (@cecesagini) on Dec 4, 2017 at 1:31am PST 1.12.2017😘 Everything about it was beautiful 😘 Thank you for all the wonderful words and wishes.
