Kenya lost Ksh227 billion ($2.27 billion) in 2015 through tax exemptions. According to the World Bank's latest issue of Kenya Economic Update, the country lost Ksh194 billion ($1.94 billion) in value added tax and Ksh33.3 billion ($333 million) in corporate income tax due to unfair exemptions. "There are significant revenue potential losses due to extensive and generous use of tax exemptions, and preferential corporate income tax rates. The estimated loss of revenue stemming from CIT and VAT only amounts to 5 per cent of GDP," says the report. Notably, Kenya issued a Eurobond of Ksh200 billion ($1.9 million) in 2015 for which it will pay over Ksh70 billion ($700 million) in interest, raising queries on the importance and cost of the tax exemptions. Treasury has defended the VAT exemptions on grounds that they reduce the cost of living on basic items for low-income households. However, World Bank research shows that VAT is inefficient in achieving the desired goal given that it benefits middle and higher income earners more when considered in absolute terms. The corporate income tax exemptions, usually to newly listed companies at the Nairobi Securities Exchange and those at the export processing zone, resulted in a disconnect between economic input of some sectors and their tax contribution. There exist over 30 tax exempt income categories in Kenya, which complicates the tax regime and increases the risk of non-compliance. "The bulk of tax exemptions are concentrated in a few sub-sectors. Four subsectors - financial services, information and communication technology, health and manufacturing - account for about three quarters of the losses in corporate income tax," notes the World Bank. The disconnect between economic and tax contributions could also signal sectors majorly affected by tax evasion that the revenue authority needs to concentrate on.
