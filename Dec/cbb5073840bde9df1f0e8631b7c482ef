FOX networks announced on Thursday that a brand new, locally produced entertainment show will hit the FOX Life schedule in March 2018. In an amazing collaboration with much-loved psychic medium Cindy Kruger, Spirit was born, and ordinary people from all walks-of-life have an opportunity to be a part of the show. Born with an amazing talent, Cindy recounts that she tried for years to suppress it until she embraced it and started connecting with what she describes as angels and offering healing through her readings. The show, which begins production in January 2018 will be driven by a mixture of celebrity and ordinary people readings. Cindy is already well-known for making guest appearances on various radio stations across South Africa. The show will feature celebrities across the African diaspora as well as ordinary folk. Confirmed to appear on Spirit are Anita Erskine, Denrele, Pappy Kojo, Navy Kenzo, Kim Jayde, iFANI and Rozanne McKenzie, with more clearing their diaries. Not only will show guests be offered clarity on certain life events, they'll also get insights into their concerns and worries, find closure and perhaps even connect with lost loved ones. You too could be a guest on the show and have a session with Cindy. All you need to do is send an e-mail to entries@foxlifespirit.tv between 20 December 2017 and 15 January 2018 and explain why you would like a reading with her. Source: Supplied
