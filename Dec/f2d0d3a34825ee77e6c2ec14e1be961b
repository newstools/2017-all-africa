National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga says the U.S. shouldn't be concerned about his alleged violation of the Constitution as far as his swearing-in is concerned yet Washington DC has been "loudly silent" on the killing of innocent protesters by police since August. The swearing-in will reportedly be based on the results of the August 8 presidential election, which Odinga claims he won but was "rigged" through the manipulation of figures.
