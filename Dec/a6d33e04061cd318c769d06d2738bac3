Dar es Salaam â€” The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (Sumatra) has issued temporary licences for 136 buses in a bid to curb transport woes during the festive season. Most of the busses issued with the licences will plying their routes between Dar es Salam and Arusha. The Sumatra accident control manager, Mr Leo Ngowi, told The Citizen at the Ubungo Bus Terminal today, November 21, that their decision stems from the fact that many passengers will be travelling to various regions and that the number of busses available cannot accommodate them. Mr Ngowi further disclosed that Sumatra will continue issuing licences to meet the festive season demand. "As we are speaking, there are many bus owners, who have applied for the licences... I am sure by the end of the day, the number will rise," he said. The issuance comes hardly three weeks since Sumatra encouraged various bus owners to apply for the temporary transport licences, which will expire after the festive season. With majority of residents in busy cities like Dar es Salaam and Mwanza planning to travel to their home places during the festive season, the main bus terminals become chaotic. In an apparent gesture to ensure that the situation remains normal during this period, Sumatra has announced that temporary licences are still available.
