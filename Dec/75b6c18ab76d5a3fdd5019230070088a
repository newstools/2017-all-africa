Wasafi Record's Babu Tale has announced that he will be sharing Diamond Platinumz's wedding date in two weeks. Tale, who was speaking during Diamond's cousin Rommy Jones' wedding over the weekend, said he will be the one to make the announcement and not the bongo maestro. "Always tunamuulizia kijana Diamond Platinumz vipi? Soon, baada ya wiki mbili hizi natangaza mimi hatangazi yeye mimi ndio ntangaza," said Tale. He then went on to give Zari a fake translation telling her they were just saying that she is looking so lovely. Diamond and Zari's body language was however telling as both fidgeted as Tale made the announcement. Zari even struck a conversation with her baby daddy's manager Salaam before she was interrupted by Tale with the fake translation as the crowd was cheering. Tale is set to make the announcement in 14 weeks even as Rommy defended his cousin saying he married before him because he is older than him. Diamond's mother whose sister is mother to Rommy gifted her nephew a plot worth Tsh80million.
