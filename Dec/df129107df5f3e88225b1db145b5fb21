The United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, has presented letters of offer and acceptance to the Nigerian Air Force for the planned sale of 12 A29 Super Tucano warplanes. In April, the U.S. government approved the sale of the planes worth U.S.$593 million, a deal which would include supplying the Nigerian armed forces with ammunition, training and aircraft maintenance.
