South African pop star Connell Cruise is the seventh celebrity to join M-Net's new reality show Dancing With the Stars . The SAMA nominee says he was very excited when he got the call to join the show. However, only later did it set in what is in store and now he is slightly terrified but up for the challenge. "I love a challenge and when I'm in something I'm in all the way. Aside from that, I think this is going to be an awesome experience. What an amazing way to learn a new skill, meet new people, and step out of my comfort zone," says Connell. Since his debut hit Not Just Friends Connell has taken the South African charts by storm. His EP Into the Wild thrust him into the international music scene. When it comes to ballroom and Latin Connell says he has a faint memory of learning to do the Foxtrot in grade 5. "I think I dance pretty well, my friends might tell you otherwise," says Connell. So, watch out other celebrity contestants Connell says he is in it to win it! Dancing with the Stars SA will see 12 untrained local celebrities put their best foot forward with the help of highly skilled professional Latin and Ballroom dancers to clinch the highly contested title. The hosts of the series are Tracey Lange and Chris Jaftha and the esteemed panel of judges and other celebrities will be announced in due course. Source: Channel24
