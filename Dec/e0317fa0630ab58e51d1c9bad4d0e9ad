Tanzanian actress Wema Sepetu caused a stir online on Christmas Day with her post that declared love for Jesus. The harmless Christmas message to her fans has however sparked a religious debate because Wema is a Muslim. Frenzied users debated on the recognition of Jesus Christ by a Muslim. Some defended Wema saying there was no harm in loving Jesus as long as she does not abandon her faith. Muslims do not celebrate Christmas. Merry Christmas...
