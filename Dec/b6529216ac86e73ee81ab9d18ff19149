Welcome to our coverage of Zimbabwe's first budget presentation in the post-Robert Mugabe era, and it promises to be a humdinger. Its two weeks since Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn-in as president to complete a remarkable turn of fortunes after he was fired from the government on November 6 by his predecessor, thanks to the intervention of the military. And he has promised to hit the ground running so the budget should give an indication of what to expect from his administration that is mostly composed of faces from the failed Mugabe presidency. The economy desperately needs injection of capital along with stable, investor friendly policies to create the much-needed jobs.
