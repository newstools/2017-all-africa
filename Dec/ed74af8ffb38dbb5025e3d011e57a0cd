Lagos â€” Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association (DAPPMA) said on Tuesday that its members are yet to get fuel supply from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). According to the association's Executive Secretary, Olufemi Adewole, while DAPPMA cannot confirm or dispute NNPC's claim of having sufficient product stock, it can confirm that the products are not in members' tanks and as such cannot be distributed adding that if the products are offshore, then surely, it cannot be considered to be available to Nigerians. "Our members' depots are presently empty! However if PPMC/NNPC can provide us with PMS, we are ready to do 24 hours loading / truck-out to alleviate the sufferings of Nigerians until these fuel queues are totally eliminated", he said He noted that NNPC imports and distributes through DAPPMA; Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) adding that DAPPMA members pay PPMC/NNPC in advance for petroleum products and fully paid up PMS orders that have neither been programmed nor loaded in excess of 500,000 metric tons, about 800 million litres as at today and enough to meet the nation's needs for 19 days at a daily estimated consumption of 35,000,000 litres Adewole said the depot owners abandoned fuel import when landing cost has existed the ex-depot price fixed by the federal government. Landing cost of PMS in Nigeria is above N145 per litre which means that any of our members that imports would have to resort to subsidy claims, a policy already jettisoned by the Federal Government. "Historically, DAPPMA members imported about 65% of the nation's total fuel consumption, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria: MOMAN imports about 15% and PPMC/NNPC import the balance of 20% however this scenario changed drastically due to several challenges faced by marketers.Fuel marketers remain committed to the progress of the nation and its citizenry as therein lies our own profitability and fulfillment", he said.
