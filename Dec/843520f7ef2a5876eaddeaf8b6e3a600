A picture of a man mimicking rapper Khaligraph Jones' grand entrance in a coffin at the Jameson Connect concert last weekend has left Kenyans online in stitches. Khaligraph pulled the stunt that left the audience in awe after 'pallbearers' dressed in black carried him on stage in a white coffin. The controversial rapper then proceeded to perform his hit song Mazishi. The reenactment of Khaligpah's stunt is however a hilarious mimicry featuring a man dressed in black emerging from a metallic suitcase holding what looks like a large serving spoon instead of a microphone. Here's what Kenyans on Twitter had to say about the #KhaligraphChallenge: Want to be a Kenyan after this life ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚#khaligraphchallenge pic.twitter.com/Dj2GyRHBaw -- #Whisperer (@rasat_) December 5, 2017 This is funny ...
