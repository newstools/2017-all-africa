Mitigating the economic and social impact of the Western Cape's ongoing drought was one of the top priorities during Economic Opportunities Minister, Alan Winde's budget allocation today (30 November 2017). Minister Winde tabled the adjustment allocations for the departments of Agriculture and Economic Development and Tourism in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament this morning. Key allocations in both departments include: R2 million for water tanks for food gardens in the West Coast, Cape Winelands, Eden and Central Karoo districts. This water supply will sustain the food gardens to ensure that families have access to healthy food. Food gardens are also an economic driver, especially in rural communities, where residents sell surplus to earn an extra income. R10 million in the installation of boreholes to ensure that residents and farms in rural communities have access to drinking water. Construction will commence as soon as possible in the Matzikama area, as well as critical areas where the need for additional water supply to humans and animals is the greatest; R5 million to clearing alien vegetation along the Berg River. In many instances, alien plants consume more water than indigenous plants, draining underground water sources. Alien species also limit the flow of water into our rivers. The Berg River project will create 40 work opportunities and 20 000 person days of employment; R7.8 million in drought assistance to research farms so they are able to continue research to help better prepare for the changing weather patterns; R2.5 million is reallocated to our Water Resilience project, which assists with GreenCape's support of businesses during this water crisis; The full speeches for both departments are attached.
