Kenya's star girl Lupita Nyong'o is shooting a really scary movie. The Oscar winning actress is shooting the Little Monsters, a zombie comedy, alongside Josh Gad. The actress on Friday morning posted a picture holding a freshly severed human replica head captioning it 'zombie slayin". Another showed two male actors each holding a "head". She captioned it: "heads gonna roll." The actress, who is daughter of Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o, also shared a video where she is partly covered in blood while in a conversation with Gad. @JoshGad tried it! #StarWars #TheLastJedi #Spoilers at #LittleMonstersFilm #ignoretheblood.

"Dave's intentions are complicated by the presence of Teddy McGiggle (Gad) the world's most famous kids show personality -- and competition for Miss Caroline's affections. One thing none of them bargained for, however, is a sudden zombie outbreak, from which Dave and Miss Caroline must protect the children," adds Deadline. The actress wears a ring and this got some of her fans confused. venessalee20 wondered: "So we finna act like we dont see the ring on Lupita's finger." But Blackbaggyeyes corrected her: "@venessalee20 the character she's playing is married."
