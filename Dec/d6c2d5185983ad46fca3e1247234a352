Former Head of State Abdulsalami Abubakar, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and his Imo State counterpart Rochas Okorocha were among dignitaries that unveiled a book written in honour of Ambassador Shehu Malami yesterday in Abuja. The event was part of activities marking Malami's 80th birthday. The book, 'Shehu Malami, A Prince of the Caliphate,' is a collection of speeches and commentaries on the former Nigerian High Commissioner to South Africa described at the unveiling as a 'detribalized Nigerian' who worked to unite the country. The trio of Abdulsalami, Tamuwal and Okorocha as well as other dignitaries who spoke at the occasion, described Malami's life as a mirror of how a united Nigeria should be. Abdulsalami said both as a citizen around the country and as Nigeria's diplomat abroad, Malami did well at projecting Nigeria's image, and that while he (Abdulsalami) was head of state, he was a witness to how Malami made Nigeria a country that South Africans respected. Rochas Okorocha said he had known Malami a long way back, adding that Malami has more friends in the southern part of the country than in the North. "His lifestyle has shown how easy it is to downplay our differences and live as one people," Okorocha said. Shehu Malami is a businessman and holder of the title of Sarkin Sudan of Wurno, who has at different times in the past been mentioned as a contender for the position of Sultan of Sokoto.
