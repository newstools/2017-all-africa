For the first time, Somali Prime Minister Mr Hassan Ali Kheyre talked about reasons why the American government has withdrawn from funding the armed forces. Mr Kheyre first ruled out that the reasons for the withdrawal are due to corruption and mismanagement in the government as published by the media recently. While answering questions raised by journalists, Mr Kheyre said that the decision was reached in an agreement between the Somali government and that of America to know how the Army budget is used. The prime minister added that it's not easy to build an organized and strong national army but both the federal government and the international community have a strong belief that the country will have one considering the steps that have been taken so far and the plans in place. He requested the citizens to have a hope in the government and also play their part in moving the country forward.
