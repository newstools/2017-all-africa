Uganda continues to pursue business opportunities in Russia after senior officials from both countries recently met in Moscow to discuss how they can cement trade ties. Johnson Agara Olwa, Uganda's ambassador to Russia, met Alexander Kopkov, Russia's director of International Cooperation Department recently. The two discussed how Russia can widen its interest beyond the extractives to agricultural initiatives such as coffee growing. "While Russia has a keen interest in mining, renewable energy and machinery, among others, Uganda is inviting Russian Investors to consider investing in coffee, tea and fruits among other products that Uganda is exposing to Russian consumers," according to a statement from Uganda's ministry of Foreign Affairs. The meeting was the start of preparations for the 2nd Intergovernmental Commission between the two countries slated to take place in May 2018. The meeting will seek ways to deepen the relationship between the two states. For much of 2017, Russia and Uganda's discussions have centered around the development of nuclear energy. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in June, which established "a framework for cooperation with a focus on development of nuclear power infrastructure in the Republic of Uganda and the uses of radioisotopes and radiation technologies, applications in industry, medicine, agriculture and other areas." Uganda's foreign affairs ministry said the country's embassies, under the Commercial Diplomacy Program, have been urged to promote Uganda as an investment destination.
