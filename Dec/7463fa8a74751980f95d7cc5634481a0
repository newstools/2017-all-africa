Sisay also indicated that the country has allocated over 30 billion Birr to construct eleven industrial parks across the country this fiscal year alone. "Those industrial parks that have gone operational have so far proven successful towards the industrialization development ."

They as well ease farmers market chain challenges, he noted. The country has planned to construct 25 industrial parks , some are finished , some are under construction, others are on the pipeline.
