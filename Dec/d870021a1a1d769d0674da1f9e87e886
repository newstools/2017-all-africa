The potential of Tourism in poverty alleviation and to induce transformative change has been addressed in Lusaka, capital city of Zambia, in the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Conference on Promoting Sustainable Tourism, a Tool for Inclusive Growth and Community Engagement in Africa. The Conference, a flagship event of the Africa region for the celebration of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, opened on November 16 and lasted till 18, and was coordinated by the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) in cooperation with the Government of Zambia. According to UNWTO statistical data, the African continent had an increase of international arrivals of 8% in 2016, compared to the previous year.
