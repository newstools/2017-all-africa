Friday, February 3, 2017 was a special day at the African Development Bank headquarters in Abidjan. This was the finale of the televised competition "Voix des Jeunes" ("Youth Voices"), launched by the Senegal-based civic leadership centre, Social Change Factory. This year, the chosen theme for the teams is one of the Bank's development priorities: agriculture and youth employment, an issue that cuts across the AfDB's High 5 priorities. The Bank also launched its Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy in 2016.
