Financial Times has allegedly reported that Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed has asked her UK counterpart Boris Johnson to recognise the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Times also quoted an e-mail allegedly sent by Kenyan ambassador to Brussels Johnson Weru that suggested he was pushing other nations to congratulate Kenyatta after securing a second term, following a disputed repeat election after his August 8 win was annulled by the Supreme Court in a petition filed by his main challenger Raila Odinga.
