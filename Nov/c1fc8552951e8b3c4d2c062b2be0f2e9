Abuja â€” The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has said that it will not allow the electricity distribution companies' (DisCos) notice of declaration of force majeure to get into crisis situation in the power sector. Further, the NERC said that it is currently closely monitoring the bone of contention between the DisCos and Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) over the legality of Eligible Customers as declared by the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and the recent threat of declaration of force majeure by the DisCos. The NERC Commissioner, Legal, Licensing and Compliance, Dafe Akpeneye, who was responding to DisCos' recent position, described the notice of force majeure declaration as premature. He said: "We respect the right of the distribution companies to see the issues the way they deem fit. But the commission will also not stand by and fold its hands. Under no circumstance would we sit down and allow an issue that is critical and affects all Nigerians to delve into uncertainty. "So, the legal issues as they pertain now are mainly between the BPE and the investors of the DisCos. But the commission is watching by very closely and we will not allow matters get out of hands because no matter what happens, the average Nigerian is already dissatisfied with things as they are now. "And we cannot allow the whole issue to get into situation in which there would be loss of confidence. So, we have taken decision to watch closely with all arms of government towards quick resolution of this matter."
