Arusha â€” Further to our previous statement. Coastal wishes to thank the amazing support we have received from our colleagues and associates in the tourism industry and the relevant authorities, agencies and government departments. Their practical and physical support has been incredible. This is a total tragedy and we are all distraught. Our first and most important concern is for the families of those involved. We are doing all in our power to assist all the authorities in their endeavours and investigations. We will not be releasing any personal details of the pilot or passengers, at this time, at the request of the families. We would ask you to respect their privacy. It would be wrong and premature to speculate as to the cause of this tragedy. Coastal Aviation pledges our full support with all if the investigating authorities. We will also be appointing our own external investigator to look into all the aspects involved in our desire to make sure that this never happens again. We expect to communicate further updates as information arrives, but have nothing to add at this time. Further updates will be published on our website. JULIAN EDMUNDSMANAGING DIRECTOR
