Jake Amo was the meme of choice for 2016. The famous picture of the then 4-year-old was taken during artist Solomon Adufah's visit to teach creative studies and art at the toddlers school in August 2015. Adufah returned to Ghana in July and managed to catch up with Jake and has said that the little boy "is doing wonderfully".
