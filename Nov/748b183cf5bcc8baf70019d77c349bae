Confirming the release to journalists, his first son, Osayomore Joseph Jnr, said the family is making arrangement for a medical check-up for him. He said: "My father has been released but he is not too healthy so he is currently in the hospital taking treatment. It has not been easy for us as a family but we thank God he is back home. We are trying to give him the best medical care he deserves. "He is in the hospital now and it is our prayers that everything goes well so he can rejoin his family in good health because we have really suffered all these while, it has been very traumatic for us and not a good situation that you can even pray for your enemy. We thank God he is home alive".
