In pursuant to Articles 83 and 151 of the CAF Disciplinary Code, Supersport has been fined 15,000 US Dollars for the security flaw in the organization of the match. The South African club has also been cautioned against a repeat of such incident, or risk playing their games behind closed doors. On the part of TP Mazembe, they were imposed with a fine of 5,000 US Dollars for the behaviour of their fans, which is a violation of Articles 82 and 83 of the CAF Disciplinary Code. Mazembe retained the title won last year 2-1 on aggregate after a holding Supersport to a barren draw in the return leg.
