It's now official, singer Wahu Kagwi is a born-again Christian. Speculation has been rife about her new found devotion after she released her 'Sifa' hit last week. Well, on Sunday the singer confirmed that she is indeed born-again. Actually, she's been saved for a year now. The singer, who is married to musician David Mathenge popularly known as Nameless, confirmed her new status during an interview on NTV's Crossover show on Sunday. GOT DISCOURAGED The journey of her christian faith has been an on and off one, she explained. After getting born again at an early age, she got discouraged by fellow Christians and eventually ventured to secular music. Wahu, during the interview, detailed how four years ago she started rethinking salvation and in 2016 she made her about-turn. "Last year, now it's about one year, is when I went through some of my own issues and then it's like that catapulted me to go down on my knees and to begin my search for God. I made a resolution then to say my faith is coming first," said Wahu. WHAT PEOPLE THINK She further explained how when making the decision she only cared about her happiness and not what people would think of her. "What people think is not as important as what God thinks coz at the end of this journey when we stand before God it won't be mafans wangu, ama mathangu, ama boss wangu, it will be wewe what did you do," Wahu added. She narrated how she has been spending time with God to the point that her daughter even told the neighbours, "kwetu gospel imeshika."
