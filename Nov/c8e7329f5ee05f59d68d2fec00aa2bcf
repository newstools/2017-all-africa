The people of Burundi and Chad annually celebrate Republic Day on November 28. On this day in 1960 and 1966, Chad and Burundi respectively officially became republics. Although the circumstances leading to the declaration of these countries as republics are different, the day is a memorable moment for the citizens.

However, a series of coups and assassinations led to the establishment of a republic and one-party state. The country held its first elections on 8 September 1961, and Prince Louis Rwagasore garnered over 80% votes. He was assassinated on Oct 13. Prince Rwagasore's father King Mwambutsa became the King after it became the constitutional monarchy. On November 28, 1966, then Prime Minister Michel Micombero overthrew Ntare. Micombero abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Burundi a republic. Micombero then imposed a military regime and became the de facto leader of Burundi until 1976. He was exiled from Burundi in 1977, and lived in Somalia where he earned a degree in economics in the University of Somalia.
