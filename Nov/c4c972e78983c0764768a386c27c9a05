President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has reaffirmed his support for a two-term limit for the office of the president. He did not, however, confirm if he intended to run for a second term in 2018. In an interview with a US broadcaster, Egypt's president rejected calls by several pro-government lawmakers and media figures to amend the constitution in favor of allowing a president to serve more than two terms. It was the first time that President el-Sissi had publically spoken about the issue. "It doesn't suit me as a president to stay one more day against the will of the Egyptians," el-Sissi told CNBC over the weekend. "We will not interfere with (the constitution)... I am with preserving two four-year terms." Elected in 2014, el-Sissi must now decide whether to run for a second term. He has not yet announced his intention to run in 2018.
