He is seeking a clear departure from the policies of his predecessors but Congolese political scientist, Tumba Shango Lokoho, says "France has long been pursuing a schizophrenic Africa policy," He saysÂ  that "there needs to be a renewal in discourse, but the African heads of state, who are often in office for a long time, are strategic partners in France." It's through them that France got involved, he says.
