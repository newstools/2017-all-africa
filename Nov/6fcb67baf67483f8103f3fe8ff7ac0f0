Road officials will be deployed in their numbers to keep watch over the country's hazardous routes this festive season. Over one million vehicles will be stopped to check vehicle and driver fitness during this festive season, said the Director-General of the Department of Basic Education, Mathanzima Mweli, who briefed the media on Thursday on developments and progress made in the Social Cluster. "It remains unacceptable that about 14 000 people perish on South Africa's roads yearly from road crashes. Government will heighten road safety education and awareness through media campaigns, community walkabouts, information distributions, as well as numerous other activities during this busy period," said Mweli. Traffic officers will be on the lookout for offences such as speeding and overtaking on barrier lines. The festive season is characterised by accidents caused by high traffic volumes, as well as alcohol and substance abuse. Mweli said government will conduct multi-disciplinary law enforcement operations to ensure the safety of road users, including pedestrians. "Our roads will be monitored to ensure that people are not jay walking and no freeway crossing, particularly in informal settlement areas." Drinking and walking will also be strongly monitored. Mweli encouraged civil society to participate in road safety campaigns throughout this season.
