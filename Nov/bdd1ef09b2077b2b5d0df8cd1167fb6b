The Kenyan Kalasha International Awards seeks to honour and represent the five original branches of Film making: Directors, Actors, Writers, Producers and Technicians but has since extended that to include even more related categories. The Kenya Film Commission registered 237 films this year, which is the highest number of films ever submitted for Kalasha Awards since it's inception in 2010. This year, the Kalasha International has been split in three with the Kalasha International Film Festival set from 4th - 8th December 2017, the Kalasha Awards gala on 9th December and the Kalasha Market set for March 2018. Notable nominees include the film Kati Kati that has a remarkable 13 nominations and a solo feature in the best special features category making them this years favourite. Another notable nominee is the XYZ show a Kenyan satirical puppet show that has brazenly tackled the type of political issues that not many would venture into, with comedic flair.
