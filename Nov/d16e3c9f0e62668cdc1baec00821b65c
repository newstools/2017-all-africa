Bamako â€” THE United Nations mission in Mali (Minusma) has mourned the killing of three peacekeepers by rebel groups in the country. The peacekeepers from Chad were killed when their vehicle escorting a MINUSMA logistics convoy hit an explosive device in the northern Kidal region. Abdoulaye Ali Abderassoul, Ndonodji Issackar Laysam and Nadjibaye Jacob Djibiya, lost their lives. "These brave peacekeepers have chosen to leave their families and countries to serve in Mali," said Mahamat Saleh Annadif, head of Minusma. In recent times, the majority of peacekeepers killed and wounded in Mali have been killed by mines or improvised explosive devices. On Tuesday, the Malian Armed Forces intervened near Tenenkou to rescue the convoy of the President of the High Court of Justice, Abdrahamane Niang, which was targeted through explosive devices. Jihadist groups are making the environment hostile for peacekeepers in Mali, where 10 000 UN peacekeepers are deployed. Attacks against peacekeepers, aid workers and the military are prevalent. Annadif urged the peacekeepers not to relent despite rising attacks. "They must adapt to this new type of enemy," he said. The Security Council established Minusma in 2013 to support political processes and carry out a number of security-related tasks in the West African country of 18 million people.
