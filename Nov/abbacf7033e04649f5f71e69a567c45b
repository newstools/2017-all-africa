Controversial South African dancer and socialite, Zodwa Wabantu, is next week staging a show in Harare. Zodwa, who cancelled her Harare show in September after it had been politicized, is on the 10th of November going to be hosted by one of the capital's modern night outings, Private Lounge. Joe Metro, the Private Lounge senior DJ and resident, told New Zimbabwe in Harare on Thursday that unlike what happened in September, Zodwa was this time coming. "Her papers (contracts) have been processed and we will be having her on 10 November for the official opening of the renovated Private Lounge," he said. "Preparations for the show are progressing well and we are being overwhelmed by calls from revellers making advance bookings," said DJ Metro. Zodwa made headlines in September afte she had announced her intention to come to Zimbabwe. This was caused by actress Anne Nhira who had written a letter to the then acting Tourism Minister Patrick Zhuwao complaining about the planning coming in of the controversial performer. Nhira in her letter said Wabantu should not be allowed in the country because of her dressing which according to her was going to "contaminate" Zimbabweans.
