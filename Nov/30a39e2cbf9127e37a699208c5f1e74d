Machakos governor Alfred Mutua has promised to name a road in his constituency after celebrated comedian Daniel Ndambuki better known as Churchill. The governor made the offer during the comedian's grand birthday party dubbed Churchill@40 which was held on Friday night at Kenyatta International Convention Centre. "What you have done for this country is great and I promise to tarmac and name the road that leads to your home after you," said Mutua during the sold out event whose audience included Churchill's fellow entertainers and political leaders. The event however turned out to be a praise show for the man of the hour and not a night of comedy. Churchill expressed his gratitude and privilege in witnessing the growth of comedy over the last 15 years ago. "I am happy to see comedy in Kenya become not only a full-fledged career for professionals, but also one of the most lucrative careers in the country. It is an achievement I'm proud of," he said.
