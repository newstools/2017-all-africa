Cabinet has cautioned communities to use water more wisely as the levels in South Africa's dams remain critical. The current dam levels in the country remain a concern as there is more evaporation than rainfall. "Cabinet encourages everyone to play their part in saving and using water wisely and sparingly," Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said on Thursday. She was briefing the media in Cape Town following a Cabinet meeting which was held on Wednesday. Minister Kubayi-Ngubane said South Africa has not received sufficient rainfall to recharge its water sources to adequate levels, which means that the country is not yet out of the drought situation. Forecasts predict that the country will only receive its major rainfall from the beginning of January 2018. "Cabinet wishes to assure the public that national, provincial and local government are cooperating and working together to ensure South Africa does not run out of water," Minister Kubayi-Ngubane said.
