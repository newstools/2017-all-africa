A non-governmental organisation, Foundation for Economic Empowerment and Educational Development (FEED), has warned FCT residents against indiscriminate bush burning to forestall unintentional destruction of property. Executive Director of FEED, Mr Kelvin Dzeremo, gave the advice, yesterday, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said some residents usually engaged in indiscriminate bush burning during the dry season, adding that such practice had often resulted in wanton destruction of lives and property. He noted that some rural dwellers, who were purportedly hunters, had wreaked havoc on many farms, lives and property on a yearly basis through bush burning; in the name of hunting. The executive director said bush burning even destroyed soil fertility, adding that the development could thwart efforts to boost agricultural production in the country. Dzeremo underscored the need for government, its agencies and other relevant stakeholders to sensitise the citizens to the dangers of bush burning. "The public sensitisation effort should particularly target people in the rural areas to enable them to fully understand the consequences of bush burning on the ecosystem. "It will also help to enlighten the people on the potential threats of bush burning to the people's livelihoods and properties," he said. NAN
