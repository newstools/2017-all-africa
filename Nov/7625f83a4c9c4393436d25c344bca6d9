Nigeria's cross-dresser, Bobrisky was in the news for the wrong reason during the week. He was said to have been arrested by a serial entrepreneur, Toyin Lawani for allegedly cornering her customers after learning the bleaching trade from her. But the serial entrepreneur has since refuted the report, insisting that she has no hand in the cross-dresser's arrest. Nonetheless, the bad news is that the case is being moved to Abuja, having been reported there. A police source, however, refused to confirm the news, as he promised to call back which he never did when WG contacted him. But the question on the lips of many is, was Bobrisky arrested following his 'questionable sexuality' or the aforementioned cornering of Lawani's customers? Who knows!
