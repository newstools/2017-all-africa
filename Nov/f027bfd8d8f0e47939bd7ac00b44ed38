Cape Town â€” AFRICAN telecommunications carriers have been urged to focus on providing customers with a great user experience to achieve new value-driven growth. Huawei, the leading global information technology and communications solutions provider, made the call at the ongoing AfricaCom in Cape Town. ICT industry can play a crucial role in fuelling new growth in Africa through increased economic activity, innovation and productivity," Paul Michael Scanlan, Chief Technology Officer: Huawei Carrier Network Business Group, said. AfricaCom is the premier Pan-African technology, telecoms and media event. With a fast growing population, ICT demands in Africa are far from being met, Scanlan told delegates. Latest statistics from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) show that proportion of households with Internet access in Africa for 2017 is 18 percent, fixed-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in Africa for 2016 was 0,26 percent. The global research also found that nearly 9 out of 10 young individuals not using the Internet live in Africa or Asia and the Pacific. "A better connected digital world is fast approaching, connectivity is no longer a privilege but a necessity. We notice that African markets still have a growing, underserved user base. This presents Africa with a historic opportunity for development," Scanlan said. - CAJ News
