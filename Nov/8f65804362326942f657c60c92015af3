DIABETES is a condition that affects more and more Namibians each year, yet very few people are aware of the extent of the problem, hence the Namibia Diabetes Lifestyle Foundation was established in 2012. The theme for World Diabetes Month 2017 is 'Women and Diabetes - our right to a healthy future'. The foundation aims to among others, create awareness so everyone can be informed about Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, whether it affects themselves or those around them, and to provide support to children living with Type 1 Diabetes without medical aid by providing them with insulin, blood glucose test strips and other needs that may arise for the effective management of this condition. Diabetes is a costly condition and without the correct treatment, life-threatening complications and even death are inevitable. Diabetes is a global problem, the eighth most likely cause of death, resulting in 4,9 million deaths in 2014 worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation, almost 600 million people in the world may be living with diabetes by 2035. The federation says an estimated 19,8 million adults in Africa were living with diabetes in 2014. However, the region has at least 63% undiagnosed diabetes cases, most of them Type 2 diabetes. The earlier a person is diagnosed and management of diabetes begins, the better the chances of preventing harmful and costly complications. The Namibia Diabetes Lifestyle Foundation is planning the following projects for Friday and Saturday.
