Johannesburg â€” AFTER working with such talents as Cassper Nyovest, music executive Abza Poloko seems to have unearthed the latest gem in Hammanskraal-born performer, Vusaisizwe Nduli. Better known by his stage name, Veetaedo, the 22-year-old has curtain-raised or shared the stage with such prominent acts as Amanda Black, Dream Team, DJ Tira, EMTEE, Mafikizolo, Okmalumkoolkat and Sjava. He counts Dr Dre, Drake and Nyovest among his influences. Veetaedo is eager to step out of these big names, with a debut album coming up. "Next year (in February) I will be dropping 'Bossing Around'," he said in an interview. If current form is anything to go by, he is certainly on course to make an impression in the highly-competitive industry. Veetaedo's well-crafted singles among them "African Woman/Ntomb'Ebomvu," have been well-received. Among other highlights has been his Golide track with Young Amo and DJ Abza (Poloko) which has been as high as sixth of 645 songs on the KFC Soundbite competition. "I have been getting radio interviews and airplay, more gigs and the spotlight," Veetaedo, the hiphop-cum-house and Afrosoul rising star, said. Among upcoming gigs include the Soweto Spring Festival will be featuring on stage AKA, Anathi, Kwester, Samthing Soweto, Somizi and more at the FNB Stadium on November 25. However, he admits it has not been plain sailing. "Finance has always been the major challenge. Getting into the industry is also hard," he said. He also narrated the familiar challenges characterising many local families. "The challenges that I have faced growing up... my family was not financially stable. I had to get myself where I am today because I have always wanted a better life for my family and my future. So not having anything gave me the push of wanting what I never had and always desired to have."
