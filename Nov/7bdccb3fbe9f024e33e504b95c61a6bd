Following the country's 169 ranking on the 2017 Ease of Doing Business index, The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) was set up in July 2016 by President Muhammadu Buhari. PUBEC was mandated to remove bureaucratic constraints to doing business in Nigeria and make the country a progressively easier place to start and grow a business. Already, several reforms directly impacting on business owners have been implemented by Ministries, Agencies and Departments with the support of PEBEC. On Starting a Business, business incorporation process can now be done mostly online on the CAC's Company Registration Portal The need for lawyers, accredited agents and chartered secretaries has been made optional, reducing the cost of registration of companies Timelines for company registration have been revised as follow: Approval for reservation of names (12 hours); Incorporation of companies if application form is completed and required documents available (24 hours). PEBEC had also succeeded in getting priority bills, including the National Collateral Registry Bill and the Credit Bureau Services Bill passed to make it easier for businesses to get access to credit. It also simplified the Visa-On-Arrival process to include e-submission of applications to dedicated desk at Nigeria Immigration Service and also eliminated manual baggage searches at airport. (NAN)
