Kaduna â€” The Fulani socio-cultural association has described as a time bomb the anti grazing law, which it said is an attempt to destroy herders' means of livelihood. Arising from the North West zonal meeting of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore held in Kaduna yesterday, the National President of the Association, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello Bodejo and the National Secretary, Sale Alhassan, who jointly addressed newsmen, said the anti grazing law is not in the best interest of peaceful coexistence and the need to urgently address the issue cannot be over-emphasized. "The grazing law agenda is destroying herders' means of livelihood and we are appealing for immediate intervention to safe the Fulani pastoralist from the total destruction of their means of livelihood by current trends from some state governors enacting segregational anti grazing law which targets, primarily, the economic livelihood of the herders." The President however debunked insinuations that there are plans by the herders to attack Benue communities, stressing that Fulani are peaceful and law abiding citizens who will not do anything that will truncate peaceful coexistence. It called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, to provide security for the Fulani herdsmen, particularly those in Benue and Taraba states who are currently facing all forms of threat. According to the national leaders: "At the end of the north west meeting, after series of deliberations, we are completely opposed to the anti grazing law, and we are worried on the possible crisis that may erupt if such laws are allowed to take effect. "it is a negative law because it attempts to expel Fulani herdsmen from their grazing areas for ages, besides, that of Benue anti grazing law, no herder were involved in the cause of its preparation to get their input. To us, ensuring security of citizens should be the priority of governance, but this anti grazing law is nothing but a time bomb if not addressed with wisdom. "It is a national challenge that requires a national interventions by well meaning government, because it is capable of creating serious conflicts on the land resources, hence developing a policy of sustainable management of land resources is of essence.
