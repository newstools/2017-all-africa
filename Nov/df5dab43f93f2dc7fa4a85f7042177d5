The Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss a suit seeking to compel him to produce the missing leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. The Biafra group has asked the army to account for Nnamdi Kanu's whereabouts since the September 14 military raid on his family home.
