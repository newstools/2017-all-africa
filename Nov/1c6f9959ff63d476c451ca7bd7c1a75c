President Emmerson Mnangagwa has offered a three-month amnesty for individuals and companies to surrender money and assets illegally stashed abroad. Mnangagwa says the government will prosecute those who fail to comply when the amnesty ends in February 2018. Since 2009, Zimbabwe has been using the U.S. dollar as its main currency after abandoning the local dollar, leading to massive smuggling of an estimated U.S.$2 billion to offshore accounts.
