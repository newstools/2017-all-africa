According to a statement issued on Tuesday by Timothy Antigha, Deputy Director 8 Task Force Division, the troops encountered the suspected insurgents during their routine patrol at Aisaram village, Gubio Local Government Area, of Borno state. "As part of the clearance operations, at about 6:20 a.m. in the morning, two Boko Haram terrorists riding horses attempted to outflank them (troops), but were spotted by vigilant troops and shot during the firefight", Mr. Antigha, a colonel said. Weapons recovered from the dead terrorists were: one AK 47 rifle, one magazine with a single round of 7.62 millimetres ammunition and two machetes. Others include two mobile phones, two horses and N7000. "No soldier sustained any injury or was lost during the operation", the statement noted.
