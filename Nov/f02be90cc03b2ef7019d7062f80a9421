Abuja â€” Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, insisted that the country has successfully exited recession, contrary to claims in some quarters that the country was still in it. Osinbajo, who said this at the 27th Biennial Conference of the Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors, NIQS, in Abuja, said the economy was on the path of sustainable growth after getting it out of the woods. He said one of the most effective strategies the government employed to drag the economy out of the woods was its massive spending in the construction sector. According to him, a few months into the life of this administration, it was vindicated by the plunge in global oil prices, which culminated in economic recession. "We have, however, surmounted this setback and succeeded in getting the economy out of recession and onto the path of sustainable growth through increased focus on other relevant but hitherto ignored sectors such as agriculture and solid minerals, manufacturing, transport, and by means of new fiscal and trade policies," he said. Osinbajo, who was represented by Minister of State for Works, Power and Housing, Suleiman Hassan, added: "This administration understands very well the critical role the construction industry plays in a nation's industrial and economic development. "Apart from providing houses for the citizens and roads to facilitate societal integration and movement of goods, the construction sector creates capital formation and wealth in the country. by so doing, it generates high multiplier effect and employment on a very large scale. "Government, through the Federal Ministry of Works, Power and Housing, accordingly launched the ongoing National Housing programme covering all the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory in 2016."
