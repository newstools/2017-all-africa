Brown stated that four representatives for the Kuru Art Project, including her-self, would leave the country for the event. Kuru Art Project art printer, Ndodonyane Ditsheko, who was happy that he would be exposed to the print making industry at a larger scale, and two other artistes, Jan John and Cgoma Simon, would be part of the crew travelling to North America.
