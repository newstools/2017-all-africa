State advocate Tebogo Hutamo has said that Dr Tiego Selebano, the suspended head of the Gauteng health department, approached the high court to urgently set aside the subpoena which requested him to testify at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings. Selebano was identified as one of three key witnesses to present testimony into the deaths of 141 mentally ill patients who died after their transfer from Life Esidimeni to 27 unlicensed NGOs.
