Nairobi â€” Passengers planning to travel today via the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport have been advised by the Kenya Airports Authority to arrive at the airport four hours before their departure time due to the expected disruptions from VIP guests arriving for President Uhuru Kenyatta's inauguration. Several roads including Mombasa road, Thika Superhighway, Uhuru Highway and Museum Hill will have limited access to allow heads of states and Government represents quick access to the Moi International Stadium, Kasarani, where President Kenyatta will be sworn in for his second term. "JKIA is fully functional today," the KAA posted on Twitter. "Airport users will be allowed to access JKIA through Mombasa Rd. Traffic will be interrupted from time to time due to VVIP movement; we, therefore, advise passengers to plan to be at the airport at least 4hrs before departure."
