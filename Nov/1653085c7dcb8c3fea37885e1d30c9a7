Lagos â€” Former Director General of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Dr. Harold Demuren said yesterday the operational environment for airlines in the country makes it difficult for them to prosper. He said a situation where the country does not manufacture and maintain an aircraft and would have to send the aircraft back to the manufacturers for maintenance of the aircraft does not help the airlines to prosper. "What it means is that you are making the money and sending it back to them (Western and European countries", Demuren said while delivering his keynote address at the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ART) conference with the theme, " Nigeria Aviation Infrastructure: Development and Challenges ". Demuren said Nigeria cannot be compared with any country in Europe where they not only manufacture the aircraft but also conduct maintenance while providing jobs for their people. He also observed that the Bilateral Air Services Agreements (BASAs) which Nigeria signed with other countries are meant to serve two countries but Nigeria is not benefitting.
