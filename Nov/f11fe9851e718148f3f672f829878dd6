One person has been confirmed dead after being shot by police in Kasese as residents remember a November 2016 raid on their king's palace in which more than 150 people died. Rwenzori East police Commander Julius Tunwimuzuni said police had arrested five suspects who were mobilizing residents to assemble to mark "Black Monday".
