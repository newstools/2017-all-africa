Music fans in Westlea will tomorrow have to choose between attending Progress Chipfumo and Andy Muridzo's shows that are taking place at joints that are less that 100 metres apart. Muridzo will be on stage at Club Veritas while Chipfumo will be at Club Flora. Both musicians have similar followings and tonight they might have to share fans as they perform at the shopping centre. It remains to be seen who will steal the night and get more fans. Adventurous "night-riders" with generous wallets will likely attend both shows and make their comparisons, but the majority will have to decide whether to be at Flora or Veritas. So, who will have more fans on the night? Will Chipfumo have the advantage of being more experienced than Muridzo? Some people feel the organisers should have communicated to avoid such a scenario while others believe competition is always good for the industry. Still, others are of the opinion that neutral fans will be insignificant and each musician will just have his share of usual followers. Both musicians said they are not worried about the issue as they will give their best to thrill fans that will come to their respective shows.
