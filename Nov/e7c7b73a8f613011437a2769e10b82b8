Things are looking up for former TV girl Terryanne Chebet. Weeks after welcoming her second child, she is now a proud owner of a Range Rover Evoque. Terryanne took to Instagram to flaunt her new black machine while posing next to it. She chose a black outfit when she went to pick up her black ride and Terryanne could not hide her excitement. "In 2012 while on a working trip to Beijing I chanced upon news that Victoria Beckham was also in Beijing to launch the special edition #Evoque. There, as a young(ish) journalist my over ambitious dreams to own one were born. To say that dreams come true is an understatement. The Santorini Black may have taken forever to come home, but not once did I give up on believing I would one day own it. #Blackonblack," she wrote. The mother of two had some good karma when her second born was born on the same day that she was fired at Citizen TV.
