Tanzanian music duo Navy Kenzo over the weekend hosted a gold-themed baby shower. Kenyan singer Akothee is clearly unhappy after she was not invited to the event. Aika and Nahreel hosted their family and friends over the weekend to celebrate days before the arrival of their baby whom they intend to name Gold. Akothee commented on one of the shower photos; "How did some of us miss dis @navykenzoofficial anyway pampers on its way, congratulations." Navy Kenzo replied; "@akotheekenya aunt your welcome when Gold is born😍😍😍" During the baby Gold shower, a heavily pregnant Aika mingled with her celebrity friends including songstress Vanessa Mdee. Aika and her love Nahreel posed for a king and queen photo at a booth that had been branded in their baby's name. The event was sponsored by several corporates including Belaire who provided drinks for the guests.
