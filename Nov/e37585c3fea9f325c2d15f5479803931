As part of efforts to expand its payment platforms, the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) has engaged the services of collection agents, a conscious move aimed at complementing its existing payment channels. With this development, customers of EEDC now have convenient and accessible options available to them to pay their electricity bills without stress. In a statement signed by Its Head, Communication, Emeka Eze, and obtained by THISDAY, he said the move was necessary to minimise situations where some of the customers who do not have time to visit EEDC cash office, bank or even use the online platforms, can now conveniently pay their bills through these agent locations within their neighbourhood. "Currently, one of the agents, Capricorn Digital Limited, promoters of "Baxi Box" are already on ground collecting electricity bills on behalf of EEDC. Customers are therefore encouraged to feel free and pay their bills through these agents and also ensure that they obtain receipt (with EEDC logo) for every payment made. Immediately after payment is consummated, customers are expected to receive SMS confirmation alert. "Also, as a way of ensuring the authenticity of these agents, their locations will have banners identifying them as EEDC authorised collection agents. "Arrangement is equally on to conclude plans for other collection agents to commence collection. "Moreover, EEDC customers are still free to pay their electricity bills through its website, cash offices, designated banks, QuickTeller website, as well as through QuickTeller enabled ATMs. "We are committed to initiatives geared towards improving our processes and also ensuring convenient and enjoyable customer experience
