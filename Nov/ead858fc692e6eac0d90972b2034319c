The conference was confronted with a number of challenges which it had to deal with, including the declining mining sector, the stagnant construction sector due to the declining economy , capital flight and the ongoing investment strike by big business. The conference also had to deal with the reality of the Fourth Capitalist Industrial Revolution that is characterised by automation and mechanisation. The delegates spent a considerable time discussing the possibility of workers being replaced by machines, robots and computers. It is now clear that we need a stronger and more united NUM to protect and cushion workers against these massive radical changes on the horizon. The Conference adopted a clear program of action to defend the economic sectors, where the NUM organizes and also to make massive contribution towards the working class struggle for equality and poverty eradication. We congratulate the newly elected leadership and welcome them to the PEC of the Federation. These following comrades form part of the newly elected leadership collective.
