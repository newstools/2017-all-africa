Three months after ditching Ali Kiba recording label Rockstar 4000, veteran Bongo flava musician Lady Jay Dee has reportedly signed a multi-million shillings album deal with Pan African music Power House, Taurus Musik that is based in Nairobi. Even though the news is yet to be officially confirmed by the two parties, reliable sources in the Kenyan showbiz have confirmed that the Siku Hazigandi hit maker has already struck the deal that will see her record three albums under the label over a period of 4 years. The contract will also see Lady Jay Dee pocket returns running into millions of Kenyan shillings. Lately, the Tanzanian songbird has been making endless trips to Kenya and was recently spotted in Magadi shooting the video of a song that could probably be her first single under the Taurus stable. In September this year, Lady Jay Dee walked out of Rockstar 400 that is headed by her close friend, Ali Kiba after she fell out with the management over contractual issues.
