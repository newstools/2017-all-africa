Celebrated comedian Daniel Ndambuki alias Churchill says he 'declined' requests from President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga to attend his 'Churchill @40' show that will go down on Friday evening at the KICC. Speaking to Nairobi News, Churchill, who has been doing comedy for the last 15 years, said that both President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga wanted to attend the show but he turned down their requests. "Uhunye (Uhuru) wanted to attend but I asked him not to and explained why. The same case was with Rao (Raila)" Churchill said. NOT INVITED So why has Churchill purposely excluded the two from his invite list which includes family members, entrepreneurs, media personalities and politicians? "With the situation still volatile in the country and as things seems to be, my event won't be an ideal place for them because they will steal my moment," Churchill explained. The much-hyped show, which begins at 6pm on Friday, will celebrate the pioneer stand-up comedian's 40th birthday.
