The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said there is an ongoing scam where some fraudulent persons are diverting unsuspecting members of the public to a fake website purported to belong to the bank. According to the Acting Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor said there is the danger of these fraudsters extorting money from victims based on false claims that the payments made are to either guarantee or secure loans from the various intervention Funds of the Bank. Okorafor said in a statement yesterday that "for the avoidance of doubt, we wish to state as follows: That the only website created and maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria for its engagement with stakeholders is: www.cbn.gov.ng; The CBN does not charge any fee from those desirous of accessing funds from its various intervention programmes." "We therefore urge members of the public to be wary of scammers, take every necessary step to verify claims by persons purporting to be acting on behalf of the Bank and report any suspicious transaction to the law enforcement agencies or CBN Branch nearest to them. Members of the public may also wish to call 07002255226 for any clarification on activities of the CBN." He said.
