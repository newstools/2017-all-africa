Last week we discussed paying a little more for a better product. The idea was that we should not focus on saving some little money by compromising on quality. Now making up your mind to follow those words of wisdom may sound like the hard part. It is not. The harder task is identifying which product is legit, which one is not. In a country with porous borders and goods coming in from Congo, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, China, Dubai and Thailand, among many others, all sorts of grades are finding their way onto the market. You will find an original, a duplicate, a high copy and a fake in the same shop. By the way, all those terminologies can mean the same thing, although a high copy is the closest to the original product as you can get. For example, an original Louis Vuitton handbag may range from 20 pounds (approximately Shs 97,000) to 1,000 pounds (Shs 4.8m)depending on design, size and the general price of the collection. When you see them being displayed downtown and slay queens pausing around with them, do not stop wondering if they can splash a cool Shs 1m or more on a bag. The same applies for beauty products. There are high copies in Dubai, very low grades in China and very confusing ones because they are packed in original packaging but are so fake on the inside. I do not want to suggest that it is a game of luck finding a genuine product, but you may need a second opinion other than that of the seller. Otherwise, it is not easy. I wish you luck. You will need it.
