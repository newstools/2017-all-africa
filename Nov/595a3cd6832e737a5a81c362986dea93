House On The Rock Church has announced the 12th edition of its annual gospel concert, The Experience. It is scheduled to hold on December 1, 2017 from 7:00p.m. till dawn at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. The theme of this year's edition is "Jesus Our King." Speaking on the all-night worship concert, the Convener and Senior Pastor of House on The Rock, Paul Adefarasin, said: "The Experience is a gathering point for the Christian community and its many constituencies from across Nigeria, Africa and indeed, the world. "It features the very best of indigenous and international artists leading hundreds of thousands of people in worship and praise to our King and also provides an uncommon opportunity for all Christians regardless of creed, doctrine or ethnicity to offer prayers for our nation." This year's edition promises to be no less exciting as Don Moen, Donnie McClurkin, Travis Greene, Tope Alabi, Chevelle Franklyn, Chioma Jesus, Sonnie Badu, Onos, Micah Stampley, Tim Godfrey, Midnight Crew, Frank Edwards, Eben, BeeJay Sax, Nathaniel Bassey and The Lagos Metropolitan Gospel Choir take centre stage to minister worship and praises to Jesus Our King. As usual, attendance is free for all! "As the name implies, The Experience, is a kind experience and with hundreds of thousands of worshippers recorded in the last edition, we can only anticipate what the attendance at this year's edition will be given the upward progression in the number of participants over the years," Adefarasin added.
