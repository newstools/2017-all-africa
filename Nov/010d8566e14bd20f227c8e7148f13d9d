"The rapid growth has raised the country's electricity connectivity access rate from 27 percent in 2013 to 70.3 percent as t 30th June 2017. The target is to achieve universal access by 2020." Also present during the signing of the agreement were 23 contractors who have won bids to implement the Sh15 billion AfDB and the Sh15 billion World Bank projects. Tarus has called on the contractors to source materials such as poles, conductors and transformers locally as well as employ locals in the areas they will be putting up the infrastructure.
