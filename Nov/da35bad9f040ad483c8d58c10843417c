Awfully wrong mathematics by an excited Kenyan on Twitter has gone viral. Kevin Nanguti, who claims to be a professor, had claimed that the thieves who made away with more than Sh50 million from Thika KCB branch after drilling a 30-metre tunnel, could give each of the 45 million Kenyans Sh1 million. The tweet has been retweeted more than 750 times and liked over 1,100 times. 50M, stolen from KCB Thika. We are 45 millions and if the thieves decide to give each Kenyan 1 million, they will still remain with solid 5 millions. - Prof.Dr.ENG.
