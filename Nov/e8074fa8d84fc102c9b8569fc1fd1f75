Harare â€” A local court has postponed a case in which prominent musician Sulumani Chimbetu is seeking reduction of maintenance for his two children. The case was postponed to next Monday after his ex-wife's lawyer, Tendai Rusinahama, failed to turn up indicating that she was sick to stand the trial. Chimbetu is seeking downward variation of maintenance for his two minor children with Marygold Mutemasango from $800 to $200, citing economic hardships. He is currently in arrears amounting $4,400. Through his lawyer Ashiel Mugiya, Chimbetu also requested to cross examine his ex-wife at the next hearing. Mutemasango has however, opposed the application for downward variation, arguing that current economic hardships had no effect on the singer. She claimed that Chimbetu was a prosperous brand whose musical shows never flop. Mutemasango also accused Chimbetu of being an irresponsible father who puts the interests of his step children ahead of his own biological kids. On his part, Chimbetu argued that Mutemasango was lazy and wanted to solely rely on the alimony he paid. But Mutemasango hit back arguing that it was wrong for Chimbetu to allege that she relies on the alimony fees for survival yet he was not even paying the said money. According to Mutemasango, there was a significant increase in the number of shows Chimbetu is holding, adding that the shows are always well-attended.
