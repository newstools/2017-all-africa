Nairobi â€” Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko will Thursday unveil over 40 trucks to reinforce garbage collection in all wards as part of measures to clean up the city. There has been uproar from city residents over the filthy state of the city due to dumping on the major streets and estates. But Sonko has assured that his government is committed to ensuring the city is clean and is already undertaking a project known as 'Operation Ng'arisha Jiji' aimed at ensuring efficient waste management. He has warned of stern action on anyone found dumping garbage illegally while urging residents to work closely with county government officials.
