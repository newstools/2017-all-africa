A group of 24 artistes discovered and trained by the Dreamstar Talent Search Show left the country yesterday for China where they will perform and showcase Zimbabwean talents on some of the biggest platforms in China. Once in China, the team will also travel to Nanjing where they will meet up with the Dreamstar-Nanjing Arts -- a group of six Dreamstar talents -- which has been residing and working for the past seven months before heading to Beijing. Jacaranda Culture and Media Corporation (JCMC) marketing executive Tinashe Kitchen said the troupe consists of 2015 and 2016 finalists who did not have a chance to visit China."Majority of the people in this group are finalists from the two previous years. We made a promise to take them to China where they can exchange notes and get opportunities and we have fulfilled that promise now," he said. Kitchen expressed optimism that the talented artistes who are singers, dancers and instrument players will lift the nation's flag high. "The troupe has been in camp at JCMC Studios for the past month where they have been fine-tuning their acts ahead of the trip. I can safely say they will put up polished acts and will represent the nation well," he said. Only one finalist from this year's edition of the show speed painter Keith Chituku is going to work in China for one year. "I am very excited to be given this rare opportunity to work in China for one year. Art is a big part of my life and I am grateful to Dreamstar for giving me the exposure. I was studying with National Arts Gallery and now I get to use my talent for something productive and beneficial to my family," he said. The trip has been facilitated by the Embassy of China and the founders of the Dreamstar talent search show, the Chinese Federation of Zimbabwe (CFZ).
