The DA will write to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, to request that former Eskom boss of Saxonwold Shebeen infamy, Brian Molefe's, appointment letter be made public so that there can be clarity over whether he is a Reservist or an Honourary Colonel. We will also request proof of the courses that Molefe has done, which Arm of Service he is attached to and why he has been called up on a continuous basis. Reports revealed that Molefe has been appointed as an Honourary Colonel in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) at R57 000 a month, despite having virtually no military experience. A person cannot be an Honourary Colonel while also being an 'active' Reserve Force member. You are either one or the other. Moreover, an Honourary appointment is not a paid position and should not be remunerative. However, if you are called up as a reservist, you should be paid according to your rank. This curious appointment is also at odds with the fact that the South African Army is laying off Reserve Force members and using them only on a non-continuous basis. The appointment letter is the definitive answer to clarifying the possible 'jobs for pals' appointment. Kobus Marais MP DA Shadow Minister of Defence and Military Veterans
