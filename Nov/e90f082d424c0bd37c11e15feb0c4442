The case of an alleged monkeypox patient caused unease at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) yesterday. The victim had reportedly been admitted at the institution, a situation said to have sent some scared patients fleeing. The management on Tuesday had confirmed the admission. In a statement, spokesman, Uwaila Joshua, said the diseased was undergoing evaluation, stressing that the case posed no danger to staff or patient. He added that the victim was being observed in an isolated complex at the hospital. A relative of the patient who pleaded anonymity however alleged that hospital staff actually turned the sick away. "I was surprised when I saw in some national dailies reports of a suspected monkeypox patient that was admitted at UBTH. For the records, when we took our brother there on Monday, some medical personnel at the accident and emergency ward turned us back, saying they don't have facilities to care for monkeypox patients. "So, I have this question for the UBTH management. Is it our brother, who was chased away, that is now receiving treatment in their facility? Except, of course, they have another patient over there. And if we are to go by that, would they have rejected my brother on Tuesday on account of having no facility and then admitted another in their supposed monkeypox isolation complex?" the relative asked. Meanwhile, a 20-year-old lady in Benue has become the focus of attention, following possible infection with the virus. The supposed victim had a few weeks ago hosted a boyfriend who arrived from Enugu State, following which she experienced a fever and related symptoms. But Commissioner for Health, Cicilia Ojabo, told journalists it was still a suspected case. She said a team of doctors had been dispatched to take samples from the patient, to ascertain what the ailment was. She advised people of the state not to panic, adding that measures were in place to curb spread of the disease.
