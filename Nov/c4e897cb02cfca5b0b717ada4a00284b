Lafia â€” The Personal Assistant to Governor Tanku Almakura of Nasarawa, Mr. Azige Louis, has expressed worry over the herdsmen incessant attack on farmers in the state. Azige, who spoke yesterday in Lafia, said that the attack on the farmers by Fulani herdsmen was worrisome."I am worried over the dimension the attack on farmers have taken in recent times. Governor Almakura has conveyed several peace meetings between the herdsmen and the farmers to ensure peaceful coexistence, but all to no avail. "A situation where herdsmen would invade a farm and their cows eat up the crops belonging to farmers, thereby leaving the farmers helpless, is worrisome. Azige said if anti- open grazing law would end the incidence of farmers-herdsmen feud, then there is nothing wrong in enacting the law.
