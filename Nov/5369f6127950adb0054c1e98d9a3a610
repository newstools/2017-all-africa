Tagged Ehiken2017, a wedding, which held on Saturday, rocked Benin City, the Edo State capital. The extravagant nuptial appears to be taking the shine off Banky W and Adesua Etomi's wedding on account of the sheer opulence and grand scale. It trended on Instagram on Sunday evening. The bride, Lagos-based Ehizogie Ogbebor, the CEO of Sayaveth Interiors and Hotel, got married to an Ijaw millionaire, Kenneth Bramor, at the Esteem Event Centre in Benin. The highlight of the wedding was when the couple presented two cars (Toyota Camry) and declared it would be given as souvenirs to lucky winners of a raffle draw at the traditional wedding reception. The identity of the lucky beneficiaries has been kept under wraps but the bride did confirm that two cars were handed out at her wedding. Guests also got iPhone X as souvenirs.
