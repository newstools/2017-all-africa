Diamond Platinumz has sent ripples in the showbiz industry with his double release talking about all his ex-es and baby mamas. The singer released Sikomi and hours later Niache leaving his fans to decipher the lyrics' meanings. In Sikomi, Diamond regrets all his love life decisions naming an ex Penny who allegedly aborted his baby. He falls short of naming Wema Sepetu while talking of her switching political parties from CCM to Chadema. He goes on to sing how Zari came to his life and gave him two babies only for him to cheat on her. REGRETS MEETING The second release Niache sounds like a diss song to one of his women whom he regrets ever meeting. He delves into his relationship with the unnamed woman singing how she has forced her way into his life. "Nitakudanganya kwa tabasam, nitakudanganya kwa kucheka, nitakudanganya ata kwa salam ila moyoni nakuchukia, nitakudanganya kwa kuku follow, nitakudanganya kwa comment, nitakudanganya kwa ku like picha ila siwezi kukuzimia, mcheeew," he sings at the end of the song. His latest baby mama Hamisa Mobetto on Snapchat talked about the Niache hit with a lot of fury prompting many to conclude that the diss was addressed to her.
