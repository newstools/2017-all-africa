President Museveni's convoy was on Wednesday morning stopped by striking taxi drivers at the Clock Tower in Kampala as they demonstrated against monthly taxes that are levied by Kampala Capital City Authority. The drivers blocked roads that lead to the Clock Tower and vowed not to go away.

He, however, did not make pronounce himself on the issue since he was late for other engagements before promising to meet them in future.
