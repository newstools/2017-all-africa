In its continued efforts to better the lives of those living with cerebral palsy, the Rotary Club of Lekki Phase 1, District 9110, has donated wheelchairs to Benola Cerebral Foundation (BCF). At the event, the Governor, District 9110, Adewale Lateef Ogunbadejo, noted that Rotary exists to impact on the lives of citizens in the community where the club is established. "We are like a gift to any community where we are because we look around the community and become a helping hand in alleviating their challenges. Am happy on the impact of our fight against polio in Nigeria as only 11 children suffered from polio this year." He urged Rotarians to keep up the fight against polio and never give up on giving to the society, adding that the club has planted 1.2 million trees in support of their tree planting project. He urged Rotarians to keep planting trees as it helps in living healthy lives and sustaining the environment. Founder of BCF, AVM Felix Olufemi Gbadebo, commended the club for the donation. "This is the third time they are donating wheelchairs to us and it looks like Christmas already to the foundation," he said.
