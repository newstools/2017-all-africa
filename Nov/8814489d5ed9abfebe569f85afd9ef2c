Sensational songbird Sanaipei Tande has opened up about her love life, stating that she is still single by choice and doesn't need a man to be a mother. The vocal artiste, who has been in the showbiz for over a decade as a musician and a radio presenter, insists that she is not in a rush to find a man with whom she can have a baby with. She says, in the event that she doesn't find the kind of man she needs to start a family with, she will still be a mother of a baby as there are many ways of going about that. This is not the first time Sanaipei has stated that she will resorts to other means if she never finds a man to have a baby with. "Yes that's true but I'm not going to get into my alternative methods of getting a baby because what you say especially with faith do happen," she said. SINGLE AND HAPPY Sanaipei, who has several hits under her belt, admitted that as much as she is happy being single, at times she feels lonely and would love to have a baby and a family of her own. "I would love to have a family, have somebody to take care of, because, let's be honest about it, as a woman when we get past the age of 30, you start to feel a sense of loneliness and there is a lack of meaning to your life because there is nobody to live for, nobody to do things for. I look forward to that," said the 32-year-old. Sanaipei, who has now gotten into acting, started her musical career way back in 2004 with the Sema group after they won the East Africa Coca Cola Popstars Talent Search that year. After the group split, she launched her solo career and thereafter joined radio going on to work for Capital FM, Kiss 100 and Easy FM. She is still actively doing music.
