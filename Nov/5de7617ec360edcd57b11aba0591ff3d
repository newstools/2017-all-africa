President Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf has sent a message of condolence to her counterpart, the President of the United States of America, Mr. Donald J. Trump, following the horrifying news of the death of at least 26 persons and injury of about 20 others in a shooting incident. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Monrovia says a statement issued Tuesday, 14 November that a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, about 30 miles (48 km) east of the city of San Antonio on 5 November . The gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of nearby New Braunfels, killed 26 and injured 20 persons. He was shot twice by a male civilian as he exited the church. Fleeing in his SUV, Kelley crashed after a high-speed chase and was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds.
