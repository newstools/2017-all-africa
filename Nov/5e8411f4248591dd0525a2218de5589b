Barcelona â€” HUAWEI Technologies has launched its latest Smart City Intelligent Operation Centre (IOC) Solution, set to play a core role in converged Smart City management. The launch at the Smart City Expo World Congress 2017 (SCEWC) in Barcelona, Spain is in line with the city management evolving from traditional vertical administration modes to a new mode that centres on convergence and sharing. The IOC solution leverages new technologies such as cloud computing, IoT, ultra broadband, Big Data, and artificial intelligence, to close the monitoring-alarm-decision-execution loop. This solution consists infrastructure, big data and service support as well as integrated communications platforms and service applications. The IOC uses IoT sensors to collect data from the physical world and sends data to the digital world for analysis. City management personnel make decisions based on the analysis results, bringing data back to the physical world in smart actions to close the loop. The city dashboard displays the overall status of city operations, including real-time details of specific fields and areas. Huawei's Smart City solutions are now serving more than 120 cities in over 40 countries. - CAJ News
