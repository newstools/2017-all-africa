Gaje and her husband Gora Zubairu celebrated bringing the blessing of quadruplets into the world. However, the joy gave way to sorrow as one of the babies passed away and was tragically followed four days later by Gaje herself. Doctors who attended to Gaje stated that she did not survive because she was malnourished and had not attended antenatal care. Gaje's husband reportedly explained that his wives have never attended antenatal care because the classes are given too far away.
