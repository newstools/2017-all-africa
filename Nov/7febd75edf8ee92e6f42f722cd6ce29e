Awka â€” The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Anambra state has reassured that nobody is above the law in its fight against illicit drug use and trafficking. The Assistant Commander of the Agency's Operations and Intelligence, Mr. Inalegwu Ameh, stated this on a radio audience participatory programme ,"NDLEA AND YOU," while reacting to alleged shielding of military and paramilitary men and officers by the NDLEA in its anti-drug war. He stated that the agency has put structures in place to ensure that no body jumps the justice system, re-emphasizing its committed to eradicating drug abuse totally from the society. Ameh decried the level of respect accorded to people with questionable wealth by the society, which he said has led to increase in drug peddling and other crimes. He however called on community leaders to collaborate with the Agency in the fight against drug abuse by providing adequate information that could help in wining the war.
