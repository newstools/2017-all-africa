Since they started working together six years ago, Deejays Roja and Slick Stuart have grown from strength to strength. The two could be the case study of how the deejaying industry is very united and supportive of each other and the reason everyone is winning, including scoring game- changing sponsorship deals like the one with Uganda Waragi. The duo's fourth edition of their annual Mixtape party held at Golf Course hotel on Friday night is a clear testimony. The DJ set was graced by the cream of Uganda's DJs. Also present was Kenya's top DJ, Creme de la Creme. DJ Jerry from KFM and DJ Meek kicked off the event in high gear before another duo of DJ BK and RPM took over. The two have positioned themselves as being behind the House music and EDM revolution. Selector Jay is the unrivalled king of throwbacks. He took the crowd back in time musically, while Aludah played the best dancehall set as expected. It wasn't just the deejays that turned up to give support, but emcees as well. Also known as hype men, their job is to chant at intervals and keep the crowd hyped. That job was entrusted to Mr Hypeman, Esco, MC Kats and MC Wright, which at one point looked like an overkill. The crowning moment of the night was when the dynamic duo hit the stage, welcomed by ululations and fireworks. Dressed in matching jeans and denim jackets worn over white t-shirts, they went to work on their respective turntables. They took the audience, which has grown with them since the first edition at Laftaz at Centenary Park, on a musical journey. The set, strictly dedicated to Ugandan music, showed how much our music is appreciated. It also ushered in performances from Sheebah Karungi, Fik Fameika, Winnie Nwagi, Beenie Gunter, Nina Rose, Kemishan, Bebe Cool and Nutty Neithan, who performed any of their songs the DJs played. The story of this year's Mixtape party would be incomplete without mentioning the Sawa Sour cocktail that had people making endless trips to the bar.
