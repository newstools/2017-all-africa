Nollywood star, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, on Wednesday advised the latest Nigerian celebrity couple, Banky W and Adesua, to stay off social media, "for sometime." Married for 22 years herself, Omosexy as she is fondly called wrote on Instagram, "Dear Banky and Adesua, After Capetown, everyone leaves... it's just you two.My darlings if possible, stay off social media a bit.Communicate continuously, Preserve your friendship, not just your love. Even as you two have now become one, don't forget to respect your individuality. "We love you and are rooting for your special Love." Meanwhile, it seems, after all the glitz, glamour and razzmatazz of Sunday wedding coupled with a civil ceremony at the registry today, musician Banky W is yet to adhere to Omosexy's admonition. He is off to Cape Town, South Africa, with his wife.
