Kenyans on social media are calling for the arrest of a suspected paedophile who, in a chilling Facebook post, sex objectified the top KCPE girl Goldalyne Kakuya. The man, whose Facebook account name is Donald Njiiru Njaaga, posted a distasteful comment on his desires to defile the young girl. A screenshot of the message was shared widely as users called on the Office of Public Prosecution to order police to investigate and track down the account owner. Kenyans on social media also want the account owner tracked down and charged so as to serve as a lesson to other perverts and avert rape cases. Some, however, wondered if the account was genuine or a pseudo and if investigating it would reveal a suspect. A tweet of the screenshots elicited hundreds of reactions online as Kenyans called for serious investigations.
