Victoria's Secret Fashion Show made its China debut on Sunday night at Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena, which glowed in a pink hue to celebrate the occasion. Guests at the event have been buzzing about one of the show's themed segments, entitled "Nomadic Adventure." The Nomadic Angels pieces were inspired by fabrics and beaded pieces borrowed from the nomadic community in Africa. It also featured Native American-inspired headdresses and several "tribal" motifs. One such look, modeled by Austrian newcomer Nadine Leopold included a feathery headpiece that bore a resemblance to the traditional war bonnet, a symbol of respect and bravery in many Native American tribes. 'SEXIEST SHOW' It's also reminiscent of the headdress that Karlie Kloss wore in the 2012 edition of the show for which both Victoria's Secret and Kloss herself eventually issued a public apology and was later cut from the televised show. On the Nomadic Adventures ensembles, it featured heavily incorporated feathers, beading, turquoise stones, Navajo-style weaving patterns and collars that raised eyebrows. This year's show was divided into six sections Punk Angel group, featuring looks by Balmain, followed by a Goddesses section that saw models channeling Greco-Roman deities with gold laurel wreaths and ornate gold-leaf wings. "The world's sexiest show", in which 55 supermodels showcased the American lingerie brand's latest collection and luxury bras including a Sh2 hundred million (US $2) million Fantasy Bra, was the talk of the town. The musical guest included Harry Styles, Miguel, Leslie Odom Jr and Jane Zhang. The show won't air in full until Tuesday, November 28.
