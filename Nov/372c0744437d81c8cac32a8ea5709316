Uganda and Sudan have called on the international community to support the African Union Mission in Somalia. The call comes as the UN Security Council has endorsed the withdrawal of 1,000 troops from Somalia due to lack of funding. Uganda is the main troop contributor to the AMISOM which is made up of 22,000 soldiers from Burundi, Kenya, Djibouti, and Ethiopia. The AU mission is helping Somali government to fight Al Shabab and restore peace and stability in the Horn of Africa country.
