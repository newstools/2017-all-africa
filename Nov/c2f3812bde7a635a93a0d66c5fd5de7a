Kenyan songbird, Wahu Kagwi, who turned to Christ recently after over a decade of doing secular music has ruled out a much anticipated collabo with her husband Nameless or anybody else. The celebrity couple enjoy individual career success spanning over a decade but have never done a collabo to date. But their fans have kept pushing them to drop a collabo just to see how their chemistry on the vocals would be like. Still, the two have always steered off the idea. However, in July this year, while speaking to Nation, Nameless hinted of a collabo with the wife saying that the two have been recording few tracks together that they would be releasing soon. Things seem to have taken a new turn after Wahu got born again and ditched secular music for gospel music. Now she says she is not thinking of any collabos with Nameless. "I haven't thought about collaborations, I'm just excited with what I'm currently working on now because its about the place where I am, spending more time getting to know God and out of that is the kind of music you gonna hear," Wahu explained in a recent TV Interview.
