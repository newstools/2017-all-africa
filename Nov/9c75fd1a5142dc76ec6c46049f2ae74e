Former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa's allies, both in the ruling Zanu-PF party and the government, have reportedly dumped him to save their political skins after President Robert Mugabe gave the green light for a massive purge. Mnangagwa, who was fired for allegedly plotting to topple Mugabe from power, now faces an uncertain future as the police are gathering evidence to charge him for a variety of crimes from murder to treason.
