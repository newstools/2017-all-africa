No fewer than 200 residents of Ajah and Ajoh community in Eti-Osa Local Government Council, Lagos State received free diabetes screening recently organised by Aronchies Pharmaceutical Limited. The health screening and awareness campaign, was organised in commemoration of the November 14 World Diabetes Day, set aside globally to raise awareness on the growing concerns about the escalating threats posed by diabetes. The Managing Director, Afonchies Pharmaceuticals Limited, Adebayo Afon, explained that the free medical screening and awareness was organised to have an impact in the community where his pharmacies are located and to raise public awareness and understanding of diabetes as one of the common diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. He said the day was set aside globally to draw attention to the health condition that is fast becoming a global pandemic, adding that the theme for this year World Diabetes Day is "Women and Diabetes -- Our Right to a Healthy Future". He further explained that "diabetes is not as a result of consuming sugar or sugary things, but rather, as a result of the body's ability to handle glucose in the body, noting that the glucose comes from all the food we eat whether it is meat, carbohydrate, protein or fat; saying, in their normal forms, the body does not recognise them." Also speaking on the turnout towards the exercise, the pharmacist in charge of the screening exercise, Vivian Aneto, said she was overwhelmed by the way people embraced the screening exercise, saying the turn-out was impressive and people were eager to know their status as well as what to do to live a healthy life style According to her, having regular exercise, eating right and constantly checking one's Body Mass Index (BMI) could lead to early detection and management of the condition, stressing that their is need for proper education and enlightenment about the condition, especially for the women in line with this year's theme. "With proper education, lifestyle modification, including quitting of smoking, drinking alcohol, regular exercise, healthy diet and weight reduction, a diabetic patient can live as long as God has designed it, if the person follows medical instructions and the condition does not occur only in older people as is commonly believed, but also occur in children," She said.
