To commemorate its 20th year anniversary, Adam & Eve, foremost retailer of high-end homeware and luxury items store, located on the highbrow Isaac John Street in Ikeja GRA, Lagos has definitely come a long way. Growing from a modest beginning in a store measuring about 15 square feet in 1997 to a sprawling structure sitting on about an acre of land, a proven leader in the retail store industry, Adam & Eve has achieved 20 years of continuous operation in an unpredictable economic environment that has witnessed the rise and demise of several big retailers and retail chains. To celebrate this landmark, the store is hosting its annual Christmas Carol in its premises at Isaac John Street, GRA, Ikeja, alongside the Harmattan edition of its flagship Art exhibition titled "The Content" which runs till December 15th and features the works of some of the most exciting Nigerian visual artists of their time. Its 20 years of existence is no mean feat by any standard. And this has been achieved without compromising the quality of the products on offer, delivered on a platform of the excellent customer service the store is known for. A brainchild of Mrs Modupe Ogunlesi, a chartered Accountant and entrepreneur extraordinaire, who has over the years nurtured the store into becoming, without doubt, the foremost retailer of high-end homeware and luxury items. The store consists of several departments - Kitchen, Dinning, Bedroom, Leather, Gift, Children, Outdoor, and Living. A walk through the entire store could take upwards of an hour due to the abundance of quality items that engage the attention - exquisite dinner sets and uniquely crafted cutlery that transform a meal into an event; luxuriant Persian rugs; rich leather cases and accessories; multitudes of exquisite d√©cor pieces and the list goes on and on.
