If there is something Kenyan politicians know too well is how to 'behave' in church. Political rivals on Saturday attended the Don Moen and Lenny Leblanc concert held at Christ Is The Answer Ministries (Citam) church in Karen. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen was pictured deep in prayer with eyes closed and hands clasped together. Murkomen even shared gospel vibe on his social media accounts, telling Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua who was in attendance, "God bless you." The fiery Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo was pictured surrendering herself to God in worship while lifting her left hand. With her eyes closed, Millie sunk deep in worship, a stark contrast to the person claimed to have one time stripped in parliament after what she termed as attempts by male colleagues to undress her. Jubilee Party's secretary general Raphael Tuju was pictured in gazing at the podium during the concert that was attended by thousands of worshipers. Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris was also pictured with her hands opening up towards heaven as she closed her eyes. The Don Moen and Lenny Leblanc concert featured performances from Kenya's Rebecca Dawn of the 'Kutembea Nawe' hit as well as Mercy Masika and Adawnage band. "Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth. Worship Him with gladness; come before Him with joyful songs. Know that He is God... " Psalm 100:1-3 Thank you @DonMoen, @LLeBlanc7, @MercyMasika, @Bekadawn, @adawnage & @worship_factory for leading us into worship tonight. #DonMoenNairobi pic.twitter.com/UUlsbzYicx - Esther M Passaris (@EstherPassaris) November 11, 2017
