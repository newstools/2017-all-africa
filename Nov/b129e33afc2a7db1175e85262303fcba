The donation, a Suzuki Jimmy, handed over by the Honey- Guide Foundation is an essentially all-terrain small motor vehicle issued to the Randilen Community Wildlife Management Area, would be operated by the residents of the surrounding villages as a community based conservation entity in the precinct. The Monduli District Commissioner (DC), Mr Idd Hassan received the vehicle on behalf of the local villages, and used the occasion to reinforce the government's stand to ensure that wildlife and other natural resources are well protected in the area, adding: "Not only for tourism purposes, but in the efforts to alleviate effects of climate change and global warming." "Our current task is to combat recent cases of illegal and mass harvesting of logs from local forests, either for commercial purposes (wood) or domestic use (firewood), which is becoming major problem in the District," said Mr Hassan. The DC pointed out that out of all the Wildlife Management entities in the precinct, the Randilen Community Wildlife Management (RCWM) performed the best and that it certainly deserved the donation as well as other forms of assistance in future.
