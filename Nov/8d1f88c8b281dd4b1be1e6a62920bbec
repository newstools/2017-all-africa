The award winning artist, Fredokiss, real name Penjani Kalua, has dedicated his artist-of-the-year award to all the ghetto youth in the country. Speaking in an interview at the UMP awards in Lilongwe on Saturday night, Fredokiss said all the youth in the country deserve the award because without them there is no Fredokiss. "I urge them to continue supporting me as I will be always their mouthpiece. I should thank the Almighty God for giving me this wonderful chance for winning this artist-of -the-year [award] and I feel blessed. "I thank all my fans for voting for me and I want to dedicate this award to them because without them the ghetto cannot be the ghetto. If this award was food, I could have shared it among all the youth, achina freedo, because we are many. I do take all the ghetto youths as myself," Fredokiss said.
