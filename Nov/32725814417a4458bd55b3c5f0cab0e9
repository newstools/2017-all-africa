In an interview with Kasapa FM the self-acclaimed king of dancehall music, Shatta Wale, said that there is nothing extraordinary about Wizkid. "I will not see Wizkid and be stunned, I rather want him to see me and be amazed because I don't see anything extraordinary about him, even though he claims to the best African artist", Shatta Wale said. His comments immediately generated criticism from many Nigerian music fans, who have lashed out at him.
