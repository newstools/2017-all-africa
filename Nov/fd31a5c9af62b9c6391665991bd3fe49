The Uganda Medical Association plans to set up a team to conduct research on whether a person who is 75 or older has the physical and mental abilities to be president. The association's president, Dr Anthony Ekwaro Obuku, told a parliamentary committee that the panel will do the research in the wake of strong debate on the unpopular age limit bill.
