Why is it so difficult for Nigerian leaders to adopt all those best development strategies they see during their frequent trips abroad, especially on power generation, which is the crucial missing link in the country's quest for rapid development? Despite the billions of dollars spent to develop the nation's power sector, the maximum output generated currently is not more than 7,000MW, according to reports. Compare that to the present scenario in Germany, where power producers are poised to pay customers to use electricity. According to a Bloomberg report, wind generation is forecast to climb to a record on Sunday, creating more output than needed and driving electricity prices below zero. Negative prices mean that producers must either shut down power stations to reduce supply, or pay consumers to take the electricity off the grid. Wind output is forecast to peak at 39,190 megawatts at 7 am on Sunday, equivalent to the output of about 40 nuclear reactors and enough to meet more than half of Germany's total demand. German wind generation reached a record 38,370 megawatts on March 18. Of the five major sources of renewable energy (wind power, solar power, biomass, geothermal and hydroelectric), Nigeria has reportedly only deployed biomass and hydro power to some extent, alongside the other conventional power sources of oil, gas, coal and lignite. However, use of wind and solar power are only miniscule in comparison. How much it will cost Nigeria to invest in wind turbines to significantly boost the country's power sources, this reporter wonders. Surely, it cannot be up to the cost of gas flared, or the bunkered crude lost on a daily basis. In the power sector, wind power is still a novelty here. If only the leaders would take this up... wishful thinking
